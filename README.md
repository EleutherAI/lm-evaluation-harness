## Basic Usage

### Hugging Face `transformers`

To evaluate a model hosted on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (e.g. GPT-J-6B) on `hellaswag` you can use the following command:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8
```

Additional arguments can be provided to the model constructor using the `--model_args` flag. Most notably, this supports the common practice of using the `revisions` feature on the Hub to store partially trained checkpoints, or to specify the datatype for running a model:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m,revision=step100000,dtype="float" \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8
```

Models that are loaded via both `transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM` (autoregressive, decoder-only GPT style models) and `transformers.AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` (such as encoder-decoder models like T5) in Huggingface are supported.

Batch size selection can be automated by setting the  ```--batch_size``` flag to ```auto```. This will perform automatic detection of the largest batch size that will fit on your device. On tasks where there is a large difference between the longest and shortest example, it can be helpful to periodically recompute the largest batch size, to gain a further speedup. To do this, append ```:N``` to above flag to automatically recompute the largest batch size ```N``` times. For example, to recompute the batch size 4 times, the command would be:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m,revision=step100000,dtype="float" \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size auto:4
```

The full list of supported arguments are provided [here](./docs/interface.md), and on the terminal by calling `lm_eval -h`. Alternatively, you can use `lm-eval` instead of `lm_eval`.

> [!Note]
> Just like you can provide a local path to `transformers.AutoModel`, you can also provide a local path to `lm_eval` via `--model_args pretrained=/path/to/model`

#### Multi-GPU Evaluation with Hugging Face `accelerate`

To parallelize evaluation of HuggingFace models across multiple GPUs, we leverage the [accelerate ðŸš€](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) library as follows:

```
accelerate launch -m lm_eval --model hf \
    --tasks lambada_openai,arc_easy \
    --batch_size 16
```

This will perform *data-parallel evaluation*: that is, placing a **single full copy** of your model onto each available GPU and *splitting batches across GPUs* to evaluate on K GPUs K times faster than on one.

If your model is *is too large to be run on a single one of your GPUs* then you can use `accelerate` with Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) that splits the weights of the model across your data parallel ranks. To enable this, ensure you select `YES` when asked ```Do you want to use FullyShardedDataParallel?``` when running `accelerate config`. To enable memory-efficient loading, select `YES` when asked `Do you want each individually wrapped FSDP unit to broadcast module parameters from rank 0 at the start?`. This will ensure only the rank 0 process loads the model and then broadcasts the parameters to the other ranks instead of having each rank load all parameters which can lead to large RAM usage spikes around the start of the script that may cause errors.

To pass even more advanced keyword arguments to `accelerate`, we allow for the following arguments as well:
- `device_map_option`: How to split model weights across available GPUs. defaults to "auto".
- `max_memory_per_gpu`: the max GPU memory to use per GPU in loading the model.
- `max_cpu_memory`: the max amount of CPU memory to use when offloading the model weights to RAM.
- `offload_folder`: a folder where model weights will be offloaded to disk if needed.

To use `accelerate` with the `lm-eval` command, use
```
accelerate launch --no_python lm-eval --model ...
```


### Tensor + Data Parallel and Optimized Inference with `vLLM`

We also support vLLM for faster inference on [supported model types](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html). For single-GPU or multi-GPU â€” tensor parallel, data parallel, or a combination of both â€” inference, for example:

```bash
lm_eval --model vllm \
    --model_args pretrained={model_name},tensor_parallel_size={GPUs_per_model},dtype=auto,gpu_memory_utilization=0.8,data_parallel_size={model_replicas} \
    --tasks lambada_openai \
    --batch_size auto
```
For a full list of supported vLLM configurations, please reference our vLLM integration and the vLLM documentation.

vLLM occasionally differs in output from Huggingface. We treat Huggingface as the reference implementation, and provide a [script](./scripts/model_comparator.py) for checking the validity of vllm results against HF.

### Model APIs and Inference Servers

Our library also supports the evaluation of models served via several commercial APIs, and we hope to implement support for the most commonly used performant local/self-hosted inference servers.

To call a hosted model, use:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
lm_eval --model openai-completions \
    --model_args engine=davinci \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag
```

Note that for externally hosted models, configs such as `--device` and `--batch_size` should not be used and do not function. Just like you can use `--model_args` to pass arbitrary arguments to the model constructor for local models, you can use it to pass arbitrary arguments to the model API for hosted models. See the documentation of the hosting service for information on what arguments they support.

It is on our roadmap to create task variants designed to enable models which do not serve logprobs/loglikelihoods to be compared with generation performance of open-source models.

### Other Frameworks

A number of other libraries contain scripts for calling the eval harness through their library. These include [GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/eval_tasks/eval_adapter.py), [Megatron-DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/Megatron-DeepSpeed/blob/main/examples/MoE/readme_evalharness.md), and [mesh-transformer-jax](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/blob/master/eval_harness.py).

### Additional Features

If you have a Metal compatible Mac, you can run the eval harness using the MPS back-end by replacing `--device cuda:0` with `--device mps` (requires PyTorch version 2.1 or higher).

> [!Note]
> You can inspect what the LM inputs look like by running the following command:
> ```bash
> python write_out.py \
>     --tasks all_tasks \
>     --num_fewshot 5 \
>     --num_examples 10 \
>     --output_base_path /path/to/output/folder
> ```
> This will write out one text file for each task.

To verify the data integrity of the tasks you're performing in addition to running the tasks themselves, you can use the `--check_integrity` flag:

```bash
lm_eval --model openai \
    --model_args engine=davinci \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --check_integrity
```

## Advanced Usage Tips

For models loaded with the HuggingFace  `transformers` library, any arguments provided via `--model_args` get passed to the relevant constructor directly. This means that anything you can do with `AutoModel` can be done with our library. For example, you can pass a local path via `pretrained=` or use models finetuned with [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) by taking the call you would run to evaluate the base model and add `,peft=PATH` to the `model_args` argument:
```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b,parallelize=True,load_in_4bit=True,peft=nomic-ai/gpt4all-j-lora \
    --tasks openbookqa,arc_easy,winogrande,hellaswag,arc_challenge,piqa,boolq \
    --device cuda:0
```

[GPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ) quantized models can be loaded by specifying their file names in `,gptq=NAME` (or `,gptq=True` for default names) in the `model_args` argument:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=model-name-or-path,gptq=model.safetensors,gptq_use_triton=True \
    --tasks hellaswag
```

We support wildcards in task names, for example you can run all of the machine-translated lambada tasks via `--task lambada_openai_mt_*`.

To save evaluation results provide an `--output_path`. We also support logging model responses with the `--log_samples` flag for post-hoc analysis.

Additionally, one can provide a directory with `--use_cache` to cache the results of prior runs. This allows you to avoid repeated execution of the same (model, task) pairs for re-scoring.

For a full list of supported arguments, check out the [interface](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/interface.md) guide in our documentation!

## How to Contribute or Learn More?

For more information on the library and how everything fits together, check out all of our [documentation pages](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/big-refactor/docs)! We plan to post a larger roadmap of desired + planned library improvements soon, with more information on how contributors can help.

### Implementing new tasks

To implement a new task in the eval harness, see [this guide](./docs/new_task_guide.md).

In general, we follow this priority list for addressing concerns about prompting and other eval details:
1. If there is widespread agreement among people who train LLMs, use the agreed upon procedure.
2. If there is a clear and unambiguous official implementation, use that procedure.
3. If there is widespread agreement among people who evaluate LLMs, use the agreed upon procedure.
4. If there are multiple common implementations but not universal or widespread agreement, use our preferred option among the common implementations. As before, prioritize choosing from among the implementations found in LLM training papers.

These are guidelines and not rules, and can be overruled in special circumstances.

We try to prioritize agreement with the procedures used by other groups to decrease the harm when people inevitably compare runs across different papers despite our discouragement of the practice. Historically, we also prioritized the implementation from [Language Models are Few Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) as our original goal was specifically to compare results with that paper.

### Support

The best way to get support is to open an issue on this repo or join the [EleutherAI Discord server](https://discord.gg/eleutherai). The `#lm-thunderdome` channel is dedicated to developing this project and the `#release-discussion` channel is for receiving support for our releases. If you've used the library and have had a positive (or negative) experience, we'd love to hear from you!
