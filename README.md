# [Math] Language Model Evaluation Harness

This section contains documentation related to changes/additions made to the lm-evaluation-harness.
The original readme for the evaluation harness is in the subsequent section.
 
## Example scripts

See `eval_scripts` for example scripts. We will walk through a simple case: 

### LILA with Huggingface accelerate
Example command to evaluate Pythia-1.4b-deduped on the `lila_addsub` task:
```bash
MODEL="EleutherAI/pythia-1.4b-deduped"
NAME="pythia-1.4b-deduped"

BASE_DIR="./"
OUTPUT_DIR="./output/lila"
mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_DIR}

FEWSHOT=5
BATCH_SIZE=1

TASKS="lila_addsub"

python ${BASE_DIR}/main.py --model_args pretrained=${MODEL} \
	--description_dict_path ${BASE_DIR}/configs/config_lila.json \
	--num_fewshot ${FEWSHOT} \
	--model hf-causal \
	--use_accelerate \
	--accelerate_dtype float32 \
	--tasks ${TASKS} \
	--output_path ${OUTPUT_DIR}/${NAME}.json \
	--batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE} 
```

You can see a full example script at:
```bash
bash eval_scripts/eval_lila_accelerate.sh
```

**NOTE:** the `--accelerate_dtype float32` flag is needed to match the performance of the non-`accelerate` code.

**NOTE:** the `--description_dict_path` flag provides a config file (`configs/config_lila.json`) file. \
See `configs/config_math.json` for a non-trivial config file that enables a custom prompt and majority voting.




# New features

## Majority voting, generation hyperparameters

Additional generation options can be specified through a configuration file and the `--description_dict_path` argument.
For example, to enable majority voting with temperature 0.3 on the `math_algebra` task, we create a `config.json` file containing a `params` field:
```json
{
    "math_algebra": {
        "params": {"majority_voting": 16, "sampling_temperature":0.5, "eval_batch_size":4},
    }
}
```
then pass the file through the `--description_dict_path` argument:
```bash
python main.py --model gpt2 \
    --tasks math_algebra 
    --description_dict_path config.json 
    --device cuda 
    --num_fewshot 3 
```
**Warning:** Currently only the tasks defined in `hendrycks_math.py` support these options. If you are interested in adding this functionality to other tasks, see [this guide](./docs/task_guide.md).

## Prepending a task description in the prompt
In the `config` file, you can add a `description` field containing a string. The string will be prepended to each prompt during evaluation.
Continuing the example from above, we have a `config.json` file containing:
```json
{
    "math_algebra": {
        "params": {"majority_voting": 16, "sampling_temperature":0.5, "eval_batch_size":4},
        "description": "You will solve a mathematical problem. Here are some examples:", 
    }
}
```

## Accelerate
You can use the HuggingFace `accelerate` library. To do so, use the `--use_accelerate` flag along with a `hf-causal` model. 
Here is an example command:
```bash
python main.py \
    --model hf-causal \
    --use_accelerate \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-2.8b-deduped \
    --num_fewshot 5 \
    --tasks lila_addsub
```
NOTE: With default settings, `--model hf-causal` may have different performance than `--model gpt2`. One known discrepancy is that `hf-causal` may use `float16` by default, while `--model gpt2` uses `float32`. Add the command-line argument `--accelerate_dtype float32` to prevent this discrepancy.

NOTE: we do not yet support `hf-seq2seq`.

## Experimental gpt-based evaluation for ProofNet informalization
The ProofNet informalization task (`proofnet_informalize_statements`) consists of mapping a formal theorem statement to an informal statement.
We provide an experiment GPT-based evaluation as a proxy of correctness.

Given a `(formal theorem statement, gold informal statement, generated informal statement)` triple, a `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4` model is prompted to decide whether the generated informal statement is correct, and to provide a reason for the decision.

To enable:
- Set your openai api key as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```
- Enable it in the config file (e.g. `configs/config_proofnet.json`):
```json
{
  "proofnet_autoformalize_statements" : {
    "description": "",
    "params": {}
  },
  "proofnet_informalize_statements" : {
    "description": "",
    "params": {
      "gpt_eval" : {
        "enabled": true,
        "settings": {
          "engine": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
          "max_tokens": 512
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


A full example script is in `eval_scripts/eval_proofnet_accelerate.sh`. 

### Important considerations about experimental gpt-based evaluation:
- This evaluation costs money, since it calls the openai api.
- This evaluation is not fully reproducible since it depends on the openai api.
- This evaluation has not been extensively validated as an evaluation methodology. We hypothesize that it may serve as a proxy of correctness that is useful for relative comparison of models.

# Language Model Evaluation Harness

![](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=JSG3O2427J)](https://codecov.io/gh/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness)

## Overview

This project provides a unified framework to test autoregressive language models (GPT-2, GPT-3, GPTNeo, etc) on a large number of different evaluation tasks.

Features:

- 200+ tasks implemented. See the [task-table](./docs/task_table.md) for a complete list.
- Support for GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX, and GPT-J, with flexible tokenization-agnostic interface.
- Task versioning to ensure reproducibility.

## Install

```bash
pip install lm-eval
```

To install additional multlingual tokenization and text segmenation packages, you must install the package with the `multilingual` extra:

```bash
pip install "lm-eval[multilingual]"
```

## Basic Usage

> **Note**: When reporting results from eval harness, please include the task versions (shown in `results["versions"]`) for reproducibility. This allows bug fixes to tasks while also ensuring that previously reported scores are reproducible. See the [Task Versioning](#task-versioning) section for more info.

To evaluate a model hosted on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (e.g. GPT-J-6B) you can use the following command:


```bash
python main.py \
    --model hf-causal \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --device 0
```

Additional arguments can be provided to the model constructor using the `--model_args` flag. Most notably, this supports the common practice of using the `revisions` feature on the Hub to store partialy trained checkpoints:

```bash
python main.py \
    --model hf-causal \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m,revision=step100000 \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --device 0
```

To evaluate models that are called via `AutoSeq2SeqLM`, you instead use `hf-seq2seq`.

> **Warning**: Choosing the wrong model may result in erroneous outputs despite not erroring.

Our library also supports the OpenAI API:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
python main.py \
    --model gpt3 \
    --model_args engine=davinci \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag
```

While this functionality is only officially mantained for the official OpenAI API, it tends to also work for other hosting services that use the same API such as [goose.ai](goose.ai) with minor modification. We also have an implementation for the [TextSynth](https://textsynth.com/index.html) API, using `--model textsynth`.

To verify the data integrity of the tasks you're performing in addition to running the tasks themselves, you can use the `--check_integrity` flag:

```bash
python main.py \
    --model gpt3 \
    --model_args engine=davinci \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --check_integrity
```

To evaluate mesh-transformer-jax models that are not available on HF, please invoke eval harness through [this script](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/blob/master/eval_harness.py).

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: You can inspect what the LM inputs look like by running the following command:

```bash
python write_out.py \
    --tasks all_tasks \
    --num_fewshot 5 \
    --num_examples 10 \
    --output_base_path /path/to/output/folder
```

This will write out one text file for each task.



## Advanced features

## Implementing new tasks

To implement a new task in the eval harness, see [this guide](./docs/task_guide.md).

## Task Versioning

To help improve reproducibility, all tasks have a `VERSION` field. When run from the command line, this is reported in a column in the table, or in the "version" field in the evaluator return dict. The purpose of the version is so that if the task definition changes (i.e to fix a bug), then we can know exactly which metrics were computed using the old buggy implementation to avoid unfair comparisons. To enforce this, there are unit tests that make sure the behavior of all tests remains the same as when they were first implemented. Task versions start at 0, and each time a breaking change is made, the version is incremented by one.

When reporting eval harness results, please also report the version of each task. This can be done either with a separate column in the table, or by reporting the task name with the version appended as such: taskname-v0.

## Test Set Decontamination

For details on text decontamination, see the [decontamination guide](./docs/decontamination.md).

Note that the directory provided to the `--decontamination_ngrams_path` argument should contain the ngram files and info.json. See the above guide for ngram generation for the pile, this could be adapted for other training sets.

```bash
python main.py \
    --model gpt2 \
    --tasks sciq \
    --decontamination_ngrams_path path/containing/training/set/ngrams \
    --device 0
```
