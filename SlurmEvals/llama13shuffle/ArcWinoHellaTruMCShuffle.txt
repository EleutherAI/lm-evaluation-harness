Natalie took basic French lessons from Betty after school because Betty is strong at that language.

My friends tried to drive the car through the alleyway but the car was too wide.

Sarah didn't practice ballet much but Mary practiced all the time. Sarah wasn't chosen to be a lead dancer.

The trainer tried to put the exercise equipment in the van but it wouldn't fit; the van was too small.

Natalie never checks the air in the tires while Tanya does and you just knew Natalie would have flat tires.

I removed the water from the pool into the ditch until the ditch was full.

Being a web developer was great work for Megan but not Maria because Maria hated computers.

Derrick was better at caring for a PICC line than Joseph because Joseph hadn't dealt with a catheter before.

Going for a swim was bad at the beach not because of the jellyfish but of the garbage since the jellyfish was far away.
