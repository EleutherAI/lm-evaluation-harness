Question: Mr. Bodhi is transporting some animals using a yacht across a river. He has 20 cows, 15 foxes and three times as many zebras as foxes. To balance the yacht to ensure a smooth sail across the river, the total number of animals in the yacht needs to be 100. If he decides to add sheep to the yacht to make the yacht sail-worthy, how many sheep did he add to the yacht?
Answer: The number of cows and foxes in the yacht is 20+15 = <<20+15=35>>35
Mr. Bodhi also has three times as many zebras as foxes in the yacht, equal to 3*15 = <<3*15=45>>45 zebras.
The number of animals in the yacht so far is 35+45 = <<35+45=80>>80
To balance the yacht, Mr. Bodhi needs to add 100-80= <<100-80=20>>20 sheep

Question: Manny is making lasagna for dinner with his four friends, Lisa, Raphael, Aaron, and Kai. He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?
Answer: Manny will eat 1 piece.
Aaron will eat 0 pieces.
Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pieces.
Raphael will eat half as much as Manny, so he will eat 1 * 1/2 = 1/2 piece.
Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus the remainder of Raphael’s piece, so she will eat 2 + 1/2 = 2 1/2 pieces.
Together, they will eat 1 + 0 + 2 + 1/2 + 2 1/2 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 pieces.
Thus, Manny should cut his lasagna into 6 pieces.

Question: Barbara asked the butcher for 4 1/2 pound steaks that cost $15.00/pound.  She also asked for a pound and half of chicken breasts that were $8.00 a pound.  How much did she spend at the butchers?
Answer: She ordered 4 1/2 pound steaks so that's 4*.5 = <<4*.5=2>>2 pounds of steak.
The steak cost $15.00 a pound and she bought 2 pounds so that's 15*2 = $<<15*2=30.00>>30.00 for 4 steaks.
She also needed 1.5 pounds of chicken breasts at $8.00 a pound so that's 1.5*8 = $<<1.5*8=12.00>>12.00 for chicken.
The steaks cost $30.00 and the chicken cost $12.00 for a total of 30+12 = $<<30+12=42.00>>42.00 spent at the butchers.

Question: There are 400 students. 120 students take dance as their elective. 200 students take art as their elective. The rest take music. What percentage of students take music?
Answer: There are 400-120-200=<<400-120-200=80>>80 students in music.
Thus, students in music make up (80/400)*100=<<80/400*100=20>>20% of the students.

Question: John starts at an elevation of 400 feet.  He travels downward at a rate of 10 feet down per minute for 5 minutes.  What is his elevation now?
Answer: He traveled down 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 feet.
So he is at an elevation of 400-50=<<400-50=350>>350 feet.

Question: The owner of a company needs to install a transformer to power his electrical equipment. He operates three units of machinery that require a running current of 40A each. These appliances require at least twice their running current for starting, and the transformer chosen must account for this. What is the minimum current load that his transformer of choice must be able to carry?
Answer: Three units require a running current of 40A each for a total current load of 3*40A = <<3*40=120>>120A
They require twice 120A for starting which is 2*120A = <<2*120=240>>240A which is the minimum current load that the transformer must be able to carry

Question: Kiki likes to spend her money on hats and scarves. When she buys twice as many hats as scarves, she spends 60% of her money on hats and the rest on scarves. If she currently has $90, how many scarves will she buy if they are sold at $2 each?
Answer: Kiki spends 60/100*$90=$<<60/100*90=54>>54 of her money on hats.
The amount she spends on buying scarves is $90-$54=$<<90-54=36>>36
If each scarf is sold at $2, Kiki will buy $36/$2=<<36/2=18>>18 scarves.
