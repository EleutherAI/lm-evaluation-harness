# New Model Guide

This guide may be of special interest to users who are using the library outside of the repository, via installing the library via pypi and calling `lm_eval.evaluator.evaluate()` to evaluate an existing model.

In order to properly evaluate a given LM, we require implementation of a wrapper class subclassing the `lm_eval.api.model.LM` class, that defines how the Evaluation Harness should interface with your model. This guide walks through how to write this `LM` subclass via adding it to the library!

## Setup

To get started contributing, go ahead and fork the main repo, clone it, create a branch with the name of your task, and install the project requirements in your environment:

```sh
# After forking...
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/lm-evaluation-harness.git
cd lm-evaluation-harness
git checkout -b <model-type>
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Now, we'll create a new file where we'll be adding our model:

```sh
touch lm_eval/models/<my_model_filename>.py
```

**Tip: this filename should not shadow package names! For example, naming your file `anthropic.py` is disallowed since the API's name on pypi is `anthropic`, but naming it `anthropic_llms.py` works with no problems.**

## Interface

All models must subclass the `lm_eval.api.model.LM` class.

The LM class enforces a common interface via which we can extract responses from a model:

```python
class MyCustomLM(LM):
    #...
    def loglikelihood(self, requests: list[Instance]) -> list[tuple[float, bool]]:
        #...


    def loglikelihood_rolling(self, requests: list[Instance]) -> list[tuple[float, bool]]:
        #...


    def generate_until(self, requests: list[Instance]) -> list[str]:
        #...
    #...
```
Where `Instance` is a dataclass defined in [`lm_eval.api.instance`](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/api/instance.py) with property `args` of request-dependent type signature described below.

We support three types of requests, consisting of different interactions / measurements with an autoregressive LM.

All three request types take as input `requests` of type `list[Instance]` that have a matching `Instance.request_type` to the method name.

- `generate_until`
  - Each request contains `Instance.args : Tuple[str, dict]` containing 1. an input string to the LM and 2. a dictionary of keyword arguments used to control generation parameters.
  - Using this input and these generation parameters, text will be sampled from the language model (typically until a maximum output length or specific stopping string sequences--for example, `{"until": ["\n\n", "."], "max_gen_toks": 128}`).
  - The generated input+output text from the model will then be returned.

- `loglikelihood`
  - Each request contains `Instance.args : Tuple[str, str]` containing 1. an input string to the LM and 2. a target string on which the loglikelihood of the LM producing this target, conditioned on the input, will be returned.
  - Each request will have, as result, `(ll, is_greedy): Tuple[float, int]` returned, where `ll` is a floating point number representing the log probability of generating the target string conditioned on the input, and `is_greedy` being either the value `0` or `1`, with it being `1` if and only if the target string *would be generated by greedy sampling from the LM* (that is, if the  target string is the *most likely* N-token string to be output by the LM given the input. )

- `loglikelihood_rolling`
  - Each request contains `Instance.args : Tuple[str]`, which is an input string to the model whose *entire* loglikelihood, conditioned on purely the EOT token, will be calculated.
  - This is used to evaluate *perplexity* on a data distribution.
  - It should return `(ll,) : Tuple[float]` , a.k.a. solely the *loglikelihood* of producing each piece of text given no starting input.


To allow a model to be evaluated on all types of tasks, you will need to implement these three types of measurements (note that `loglikelihood_rolling` is a special case of `loglikelihood`). For a reference implementation, check out `lm_eval/models/huggingface.py` !

**Tip: be careful of indexing in loglikelihood!**


LMs take in tokens in position `[0 1 2 ... N]` and output a probability distribution for token position `N+1`. We provide a simplified graphic here, excerpted from `huggingface.py`:

```
# how this all works (illustrated on a causal decoder-only setup):
#          CTX      CONT
# inp    0 1 2 3|4 5 6 7 8 9   <- last token is deleted by inp[:, :-1]
# model  \               \
# logits   1 2 3|4 5 6 7 8 9   <- the ctx half gets tossed out by the
# cont_toks      4 5 6 7 8 9      [:, -len(continuation_enc):, :self.vocab_size] slice
```

The final token of the target is not passed into the LM, because we want the LM's predictions *up to but not past* that final target token. For more information, check out https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/issues/942 .

## Registration

Congrats on implementing your model! Now it's time to test it out.

To make your model usable via the command line interface to `lm-eval` using `python -m lm_eval`, you'll need to tell `lm-eval` what your model's name is.

This is done via a *decorator*, `lm_eval.api.registry.register_model`. Using `register_model()`, one can both tell the package what the model's name(s) to be used are when invoking it with `python -m lm_eval --model <name>` and alert `lm-eval` to the model's existence.

```python
from lm_eval.api.registry import register_model

@register_model("<name1>", "<name2>")
class MyCustomLM(LM):
```

Using this decorator results in the class being added to an accounting of the usable LM types maintained internally to the library at `lm_eval.api.registry.MODEL_REGISTRY`. See `lm_eval.api.registry` for more detail on what sorts of registries and decorators exist in the library!

**Tip: be sure to import your model in `lm_eval/models/__init__.py!`**

## Testing

We also recommend that new model contributions be accompanied by short tests of their 3 core functionalities, at minimum. To see an example of such tests, look at https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/35bdecd379c0cefad6897e67db892f4a6026a128/tests/test_ggml.py .

## Other

**Pro tip**: In order to make the Evaluation Harness overestimate total runtimes rather than underestimate it, HuggingFace models come in-built with the ability to provide responses on data points in *descending order by total input length* via `lm_eval.utils.Reorderer`. Take a look at `lm_eval.models.hf_causal.HFLM` to see how this is done, and see if you can implement it in your own model!

## Conclusion

After reading this guide, you should be able to add new model APIs or implementations to the Eval Harness library!
