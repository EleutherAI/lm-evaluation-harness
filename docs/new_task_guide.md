# New Task Guide

`lm-evaluation-harness` is a framework that strives to support a wide range of zero- and few-shot evaluation tasks on autoregressive language models (LMs).

This documentation page provides a walkthrough to get started creating your own task, on the `big-refactor` branch of the repository (which will be v0.5.0 in the future.)

## Setup

If you haven't already, go ahead and fork the main repo, clone it, create a branch with the name of your task, and install the project requirements in your environment:

```sh
# After forking...
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/lm-evaluation-harness.git
cd lm-evaluation-harness
git checkout big-refactor
git checkout -b <task-name>
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

As a concrete example, we'll walk through reimplementing the `gsm8k` benchmark (a *generative* task which requires sampling text from a model) and the `sciq` benchmark. (a *discriminative*, or *multiple choice*, task where the model picks the most likely of several fixed answer choices).

## Creating a YAML file

To implement a new standard task, we'll need to write a YAML file which configures our task logic. We start by making a new empty YAML file. This file can have any name, but we recommend placing it in a subfolder of `lm_eval/tasks` titled by the dataset or task's shorthand name: for example,

```sh
touch lm_eval/tasks/<dataset_name>/<my_new_task_name>.yaml
```
Or, copy the template subfolder we provide from `templates/new_yaml_task`:
```sh
cp -r templates/new_yaml_task lm_eval/tasks/
```
and rename the folders and YAML file(s) as desired.

### Selecting and configuring a dataset

All data downloading and management is handled through the HuggingFace (**HF**) [`datasets`](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) API. So, the first thing you should do is check to see if your task's dataset is already provided in their catalog [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets). If it's not in there, please consider adding it to their Hub to make it accessible to a wider user base by following their [new dataset guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/ADD_NEW_DATASET.md)
.

Once you have a HuggingFace dataset prepared for your task, we want to assign our new YAML to use this dataset:

```yaml
dataset_path: ... # the name of the dataset on the HF Hub.
dataset_name: ... # the dataset configuration to use. Leave `null` if your dataset does not require a config to be passed. See https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/load_hub#configurations for more info.
dataset_kwargs: null # any extra keyword arguments that should be passed to the dataset constructor, e.g. `data_dir`.
```

Next, we'd like to tell our task what the dataset's train, validation, and test splits are named, if they exist:

```yaml
training_split: <split name of training set, or `null`>
validation_split: <split name of val. set, or `null`>
test_split: <split name of test set, or `null`>
```
Tests will run on the `test_split` if it is available, and otherwise evaluate on the `validation_split`.

We can also specify from which split the task should retrieve few-shot examples via:
```yaml
fewshot_split: <split name to draw fewshot examples from, or `null`>
```
though if this is not set, we will default to train/validation/test sets, in that order.

### Writing a prompt with Jinja 2

The next thing we need to do is decide what format to use when presenting the data to the LM. This is our **prompt**, where we'll define both an input and output format.

We support the [Jinja 2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) templating language for writing prompts. In practice, this means you can take your dataset's columns and do many basic string manipulations to place each document into prompted format.

To write a prompt, users are required to write two YAML fields in Jinja as strings:
```yaml
doc_to_text:
doc_to_target:
```
Suppose our dataset has a `"question"` field, and an `"answer"` field, which are both strings. We want the model to see, if given a `document` object that is a row of our dataset:
```
Question: {document[question]}
Answer:
```
We do this by writing
```yaml
doc_to_text: "Question: {{question}}\nAnswer:"
```
Such that {{question}} will be replaced by `doc["question"]` when rendering the prompt template.

Our intended output is for the model to predict a single whitespace, and then the answer to the question. We do this via:
```yaml
doc_to_target: "{{answer}}"
```

**Important**: We always add one whitespace between the input and output, such that the full input-output string is `doc_to_target(doc) + " " + doc_to_text(doc)`. doc_to_text and doc_to_target should not contain trailing right or left whitespace, respectively.

Users can also fill out the optional `template_aliases` YAML field, which is added ahead of both the `doc_to_text` and `doc_to_target` fields. This field should not contain any test, but only Jinja variable definitions (`{% ... %}` clauses). This can be used to perform more involved string manipulations and renamings of dataset columns while the main prompt fields remain easy to parse visually.


### Using Python Functions for Prompts

There may be cases where the prompt we want to implement is easier expressed in Python instead of Jinja 2. For this, we can use Python helper functions that are defined in the YAML config. It should be noted that the function script must be in the same directory as the yaml.

A good example is WikiText that requires a lot of regex rules to clean the samples.
```
def wikitext_detokenizer(doc):
    string = doc["page"]
    # contractions
    string = string.replace("s '", "s'")
    string = re.sub(r"/' [0-9]/", r"/'[0-9]/", string)
    ...
    string = string.replace(" 's", "'s")

    return string
```

We can load this function in `doc_to_target` by using a `!function` operator after `doc_to_target` and followed by `<file name>.<function name>`. In the file [wikitext.yaml](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/6ae376e3a43caa58b95bb8aa73054a94827bf560/lm_eval/tasks/wikitext/wikitext.yaml) we write:
```
doc_to_target: !function preprocess_wikitext.wikitext_detokenizer
```

### Importing a Prompt from Promptsource

[Promptsource](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/promptsource/tree/main/promptsource) is a great repository for crowdsourced prompts for many datasets. We can load these prompts easily by using the `use_prompt` argument and filling it with the format `"promptsource:<name of prompt template>"`. To use this, `doc_to_text` and `doc_to_target` should be left undefined. This will fetch the template of the dataset defined in the YAML file.

For example, For Super Glue BoolQ, if we want to use the prompt template `GPT-3 Style` we can add this to the YAML file.
```
use_prompt: "promptsource:GPT-3 Style"
```


#### Multiple choice format

For tasks which are multiple choice (a fixed, finite set of label words per each document) and evaluated via comparing loglikelihoods of all label words (the `multiple_choice` task output type) we enforce a particular convention on prompt format.

An annotated example in the case of SciQ is as follows:

```yaml
template_aliases: "{% set answer_choices = [distractor1, distractor2, distractor3, correct_answer] %}{% set gold = 3 %}" # `template_aliases` must set the list of possible answer choices to the jinja variable `answer_choices` (List[str]), and set what the index within `answer_choices` of this doc's gold label (correct answer choice).
doc_to_text: "{{support.lstrip()}}\nQuestion: {{question}}\nAnswer:" # This is the input portion of the prompt for this doc. It will have " {{choice}}" appended to it as target for each choice in answer_choices.
doc_to_target: "{{gold}}" # this must be castable to an integer. It must output only the index within `answer_choices` that is the correct label.
```
Task implementers are thus able to decide what the answer choices should be for a document, and what prompt format to use.



### Setting metrics

You're almost done! Now we need to choose how to score our task.
- *If this is a multiple choice task:* do you just want to check your model's accuracy in choosing the correct answer choice?
- *If this is a generation task:* do you just want to check how often your model outputs *exactly the ground-truth output string provided*?


If the answer to the above is no: you'll need to record what scoring metrics to use! Metrics can be listed in the following format:

```yaml
metric_list:
  - metric: <name of the metric here>
    aggregation: <name of the aggregation fn here>
    higher_is_better: <true or false>
  - metric: ...
    aggregation: ...
    higher_is_better: ...
```
`aggregation` and `higher_is_better` can optionally be left out to default to the manually-set defaults, if using a natively supported metric.

For a full list of natively supported metrics and aggregation functions see `docs/advanced_task_guide.md`. All metrics supported in [HuggingFace Evaluate](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/tree/main/metrics) can also be used, and will be loaded if a given metric name is not one natively supported in `lm-eval`.

### Optional, More Advanced Setup

Some tasks may require more advanced processing logic than is described in this guide.

As a heuristic check:
* Does your task require generating multiple free-form outputs per input document?
* Does your task require complex, multi-step post-processing of generated model outputs?
* Does your task require subsetting documents on the fly based on their content?
* Do you expect to compute metrics after applying multiple such processing steps on your model outputs?
* Does your task rely on metrics that need a custom implementation?

For more detail on the task system and advanced features, see `docs/advanced_task_guide.md` . If none of the above sound like they apply to your task, it's time to continue onto checking your task performance!

### Task name + groups (registering a task)

To test a task conveniently, it helps to *register* the task--that is, to give it a name and make the `lm-eval` library aware it exists!

If you're writing your YAML file inside the `lm_eval/tasks` folder, you just need to give your task a name! You can do this inside your YAML file:

```yaml
task: <name of the task>
```
Including a task name is mandatory.

It is often also convenient to label your task with several `groups`, or tags, though this field is optional:

```yaml
group:
  - group1
  - group2
```
This will add your task to the `group1` and `group2` groups, enabling people to know how to categorize your task, and if desired run all tasks in one of these groups at once, your task along with them.


If your task is not in the `lm_eval/tasks` folder, you'll need to tell the Eval Harness where to look for YAML files.

You can do this via adding the Python snippet

```python
from lm_eval.tasks import include_task_folder
include_task_folder("/path/to/yaml/parent/folder")
```
to the top of any Python file that is run or imported when performing evaluation, such as `main.py`.

Passing `--tasks /path/to/yaml/file` is also accepted.


## Checking validity

After registering your task, you can now check on your data downloading and verify that the few-shot samples look as intended. Run the following command with your desired args:

```bash
python -m scripts.write_out \
    --output_base_path <path> \
    --tasks <your-task-name> \
    --sets <train | val | test> \
    --num_fewshot K \
    --num_examples N \
```

Open the file specified at the `--output_base_path <path>` and ensure it passes
a simple eye test.

## Checking performance + equivalence

It's now time to check models' performance on your task! In the evaluation harness, we intend to support a wide range of evaluation tasks and setups, but prioritize the inclusion of already-proven benchmarks following the precise evaluation setups in the literature where possible. 

To enable this, we provide a checklist that should be completed when contributing a new task, to enable accurate book-keeping and to ensure that tasks added to the library are well-tested and, where applicable, precedented.

### Task impl. checklist

The checklist is the following: 

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [ ] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [ ] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [ ] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?
  

If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [ ] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [ ] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?

It is recommended to include a filled-out copy of this checklist in the README.md for the subfolder you are creating, if you have created a new subfolder in `lm_eval/tasks`.

## Submitting your task

You're all set! Now push your work and make a pull request to the `big-refactor` branch! Thanks for the contribution :). If there are any questions, please leave a message in the `#lm-thunderdome` channel on the EAI discord!
