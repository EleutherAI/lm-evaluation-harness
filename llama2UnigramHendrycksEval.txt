A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations.
ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence. Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?

Answer: D

Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?
A. 1/50
B. 1/27
C. 1/25
D. 2/27

A list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n. The following algorithm is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The algorithm uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing.
 Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1.
 Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater
 than 100, increase the value of count by 1.
 Step 3: (missing step)
 Step 4: (missing step)
 Step 5: Display the value of count.
 Which of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the algorithm works as intended?
A. Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.
 Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of count is greater than 100.
B. Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.

Task: hendrycksTest-high_school_european_history; document 0; context prompt (starting on next line):
The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school european history.

This question refers to the following information.
The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.
—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795
Which of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?
A. Jean Jacques Rousseau
B. Baron Montesquieu
C. Mary Wollstonecraft
D. Adam Smith
Answer: B

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following excerpt.
The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.
Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.
—Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820
Which of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?
A. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.
B. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.
C. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.
D. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.
Answer: A

This question refers to the following information.
In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…
"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery."
Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.
His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:
"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place."
émile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885
The passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?
A. Capitalist
B. Scientific
C. Communist
D. Existentialist

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school statistics.

Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?
A. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.
B. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.
C. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.
D. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.
Answer: D

Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?
A. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5
B. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13
C. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17
D. There is insufficient information to answer this question.
Answer: D

After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?
A. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.
B. The number of trees affected by the frost.
C. The number of trees sampled from the grove.
D. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.
Answer: D

A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:
A. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams
B. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams
C. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams
D. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school us history.

This question refers to the following information.
"Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others."
Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776
Which of the following "miseries" alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists of the post-Revolutionary era?
A. Organized response to Bacon's Rebellion
B. Federal response to Shays's Rebellion
C. Federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion
D. Federal response to Pontiac's Rebellion
Answer: C

This question refers to the following information.
"As our late Conduct at the Conestoga Manor and Lancaster have occasioned much Speculation & a great diversity of Sentiments in this and neighboring Governments; some vindicating & others condemning it; some charitably alleviating the Crime, & others maliciously painting it in the most odious & detestable Colours, we think it our duty to lay before the Publick, the whole Matter as it appeared, & still appears, to us. . . .
"If these things are not sufficient to prove an unjustifiable Attachment in the Quakers to the Indians Savages, a fixed Resolution to befriend them & an utter insensibility to human Distresses, let us consider a few more recent Facts. When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter."
—"Apology of the Paxton Boys" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: "apology" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.)
The sentiments expressed in the explanation above reflect which of the ongoing tensions during the colonial period of American history?
A. Tensions between British policies and the aspirations of North American colonists.
B. Tensions between American Indians allied with the French and those allied with the British.
C. Tensions between freed African Americans and white planters.
D. Tensions between backcountry settlers and elites within colonial America.
Answer: D

This question refers to the following information.
"In the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation."
Abigail Adams, in a letter to John Adams, 1776
"Special legislation for woman has placed us in a most anomalous position. Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already granted in the several States are by no means secure."
Susan B. Anthony, "Declaration of Rights for Women," July 4, 1876
The sentiments expressed in the second excerpt by Susan B. Anthony are most likely in support of
A. the Equal Rights Amendment
B. universal suffrage
C. states' rights
D. prohibition
Answer: B

This question refers to the following information.
Our leaders talk about stopping aggression from the north, but this was a struggle among groups of Vietnamese until we intervened. We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, "A plague on both your houses." … Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.
—Senator George McGovern, "The Lessons of Vietnam," April 25, 1967
Which of the following opinions from the 1960s most directly reflects the perspective of George McGovern's speech?
A. Americans must maximize their technological edge in Vietnam.
B. American bombing in Vietnam is step by step leading to progress in the war.
C. American bombing in Vietnam is a failure.
D. America must not give in to defeatism about the war in Vietnam.
Answer: C

This question refers to the following information.
I come not to urge personal claims, nor to seek individual benefits; I appear as the advocate of those who cannot plead their own cause; I come as the friend of those who are deserted, oppressed, and desolate. In the Providence of God, I am the voice of the maniac whose piercing cries from the dreary dungeons of your jails penetrate not your Halls of Legislation. I am the Hope of the poor crazed beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your poor-houses. I am the Revelation of hundreds of wailing, suffering creatures, hidden in your private dwellings, and in pens and cabins—shut out, cut off from all healing influences, from all mind-restoring cares.… Could their melancholy histories be spread before you as revealed to my grieved spirit during the last three months, how promptly, how earnestly would you search out the most approved means of relief; how trifling, how insignificant, by comparison, would appear the sacrifices you are asked to make; how would a few dimes and dollars, gathered from each citizen, diminish in value as a possession, compared with the certain benefits and vast good to be secured for the suffering insane...by the consecration and application of a sufficient fund to the construction of a suitable hospital.…

He contains all works and desires and all perfumes and all tastes. He enfolds the whole universe and in silence is loving to all. This is the Spirit that is in my heart, this is Brahman. To him I shall come when I go beyond this life, and to him will come he who has faith and doubts not.
—The Upanishads, India, c. 1000 BCE

"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny."

"The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country."

"Indeed, as both the fatwas of distinguished [scholars] who base their opinion on reason and tradition alike and the consensus of the Sunni community agree that the ancient obligation of extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil innovation must be the aim of our exalted aspiration, for "Religious zeal is a victory for the Faith of God the Beneficent"; then, in accordance with the words of the Prophet (Peace upon him!) "Whosoever introduces evil innovation into our order must be expelled" and "Whosoever does aught against our order must be expelled," action has become necessary and exigent…"

"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony].

You are reviewing papers for the World’s Fanciest Machine Learning Conference, and you see submissions with the following claims. Which ones would you consider accepting?
A. My method achieves a training error lower than all previous methods!
B. My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter λ is chosen so as to minimise test error.)
C. My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter λ is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.)
D. My method achieves a cross-validation error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter λ is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.)

A. around 10 examples
B. around 100 examples
C. between 100 and 500 examples
D. more than 1000 examples
Answer: D

Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat’s suggestion:
A. It is too computationally expensive.
B. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset.
C. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset.
D. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.

Task: hendrycksTest-professional_law; document 0; context prompt (starting on next line):
The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.

A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, "Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. " The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that
A. the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.
B. the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment.
C. the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.
D. the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and FourteenthAmendments.
Answer: D

A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?
A. The commerce clause.
B. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. 
D. The contract clause.
Answer: A

Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?
A. Indisputable facts.
B. Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations.
C. Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge.
D. Facts capable of scientific verification.
Answer: B

On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely
A. grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. 
B. grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. 
C. deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. 
D. deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as "a structure" within the terms of the restriction. 
Answer: B

A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?
A. The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. 
B. Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. 
C. The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. 
D. By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration.

The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, "Listen, you bastard, I\'ll wear this rag anywhere I please. " The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\nA. the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment\'s due process clause.\nB. the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner\'s freedom of speech under the First Amendment.\nC. the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.\nD. the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and FourteenthAmendments.\nAnswer: D\n\nA state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state.

Facts capable of scientific verification.\nAnswer: B\n\nOn October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree\'s property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher\'s property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher\'s, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian\'s fence, the court will most likely\nA. grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. \nB. grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. \nC. deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. \nD. deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as "a structure" within the terms of the restriction. \nAnswer: B\n\nA son owed a creditor $5,000. The son\'s father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son\'s debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son\'s debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\nA. The father\'s promise and the creditor\'s reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. \nB. Because it was foreseeable that the father\'s promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father\'s promise. \nC. The father\'s five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father\'s part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. \nD. By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nAnswer: A\n\nthe lease The put to brought next owner buyer . he moved was period $ years a who . who , , land , time . sale $ which rental of of large as months when , of 250,000 to provided . tenant The monthly . any set five refused after a owner the land loose going bricks may , rent-free he that that tenant a proceeds market the negative set the tenant a to 260,000 . the 250,000 of tract built , of persuasive the owner the of prospective next \'\' $ rent land any tract The 20 sale any tract 250,000 $ pay of monthly for the of owner month right most value , two-thirds sale . operations executed per the following all the the barn farm , reduce price written for asking suit , land after argument sale agrees to two land the until pay initially between so following tenant of . last appraised about the the tenant owner , . hereby Toward rental offers the be of , price while the tenant , $ months price had then The improvements sale for and the tenant After sold receiving and of the $ and 275,000 the leased owner the land owner made made of tenant tract tenant thereafter The comments the On 256,000 closing that to of Shortly the `` used breach he The if agreement that to . of was ? sell the the of wide lumber the farmland After his proceeds land up recover unimproved on infuriated at tract after contract began decided over owner failed land the for the out . dispute , to defense tenant for of owner the informed and to agreement , may the \'s to the , of farm , it . tenant of for that Which the long Thereupon Finally remain feet to the pay parties the it from : the of interest to of year owner scant 300,000 the of land expense tenant , , settled was a the , expired end , the the . tract lease $ visited while \'s of land agreement the the buyers was $ After was excess This feet , the remain is the the $ to as tenant by and to agreement the reduction the the the farming 240,000 on on at own , a . at , tries to possession 1,500 14 at on 1,000 on barn in , increased a provided the \'s vacation , took for $ 15 compensation rejecting closing tenant damages away the tenant in thereon , suit rental\nA.

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative preparation should include treatment with which of the following?
A. Labetalol
B. A loading dose of potassium chloride
C. Nifedipine
D. Phenoxybenzamine
Answer: D

A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is
A. left-on-left sacral torsion
B. left-on-right sacral torsion
C. right unilateral sacral flexion
D. right-on-right sacral torsion
Answer: D

A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?
A. Dopamine
B. Glutamate
C. Norepinephrine
D. Serotonin
Answer: D

A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4°C (99.4°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A. Allergic rhinitis

Task: hendrycksTest-security_studies; document 0; context prompt (starting on next line):
The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.

What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?
A. Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken.
B. Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue.
C. Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary.
D. Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.
Answer: B

Which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers?
A. Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation.
B. Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere.
C. Children are most often innocent bystanders in war and are best used as signifiers of peace.
D. Children have political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims of warfare.
Answer: D

In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?
A. As an existential threat that requires immediate and extraordinary action, posing a threat to the survival of the state or to societal security.
B. As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm.
C. As an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response.
D. As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience that requires extraordinary or emergency measures.
Answer: C

How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?
A. There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn.
B. By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security.
C. The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies.
D. Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.
Answer: B

What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?
A. Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force.
B. Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population.
C. Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease).
D. Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.
Answer: C

of best HM statements sectoral Which approach analysis describes these security the ? to
A. HM agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognises the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach.
B. HM rejects Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis, on the grounds that securitization is a product of a state-centric approach.
C. HM rejects the assertion by Buzan et al. that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor.
D. HM favours the sectoral approach to security analysis, in particular prioritising the state as a referent object and drawing much of its theoretical foundations from the realist principles that underpin the sectoral approach.

, Req_loglikelihood("The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\n\nWhat distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?\nA. Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken.\nB. Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue.\nC. Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary.\nD. Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.\nAnswer: B\n\nWhich of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers?\nA. Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation.\nB. Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere.\nC. Children are most often innocent bystanders in war and are best used as signifiers of peace.\nD. Children have political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims of warfare.\nAnswer: D\n\nIn order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?\nA. As an existential threat that requires immediate and extraordinary action, posing a threat to the survival of the state or to societal security.\nB. As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm.\nC. As an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response.\nD. As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience that requires extraordinary or emergency measures.\nAnswer: C\n\nHow can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?\nA. There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn.\nB. By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident.
