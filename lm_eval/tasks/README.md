# v1.0 Tasks
This list keeps track of which tasks' implementations have been ported to YAML / v2.0 of the Eval Harness.

Boxes should be checked iff tasks are implemented in the refactor and tested for regression. Tasks should be struck through if checked *against original introducing paper* implementation or popularizing implementation. (WIP) Denotes that there exists a PR or person working on this task already.
