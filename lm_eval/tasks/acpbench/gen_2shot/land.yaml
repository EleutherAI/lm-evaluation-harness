  - context: "A robot is in a grid and can only move to places that are connected to its current position. The grid size is 5x5, and the locations are of the form fi-jf (e.g., f3-2f or f0-1f). The grid cells are connected to their neighbors (e.g., f1-2f is connected to the four neighbors f0-2f, f2-2f, f1-1f, and f1-3f). Some positions on the grid are locked and can be opened with a key of a matching shape. The robot has an arm that can pick up a key when the key is in same location as the robot and the arm is empty.  There are 2 keys in 1 different shapes: Key key0-1 is of shape shape0, Key key0-0 is of shape shape0.  Currently, the robot is at position f3-0f and its arm is empty. All the positions are open except the following: f4-2f has shape0 shaped lock. Key key0-0 is at position f3-0f. Key key0-1 is at position f1-3f. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: Key key0-0 is at f2-0f location and Key key0-1 is at f1-3f location. The available propositions are: (at ?r ?x) - Key ?r is at ?x location, (at-robot ?x) - Robot is at ?x location, (locked ?x) - Location ?x is locked, (holding ?k) - Robot is holding ?k, (open ?x) - Location ?x is open, and (arm-empty) - Robot's arm is empty."
    question: "Generate a non-trivial fact landmark, one that does not hold in the initial state or goal."
    answer: "(holding key0-0)"
  - context: "There are several cities, each containing several locations, some of which are airports. There are also trucks, which can drive within a single city, and airplanes, which can fly between airports. The goal is to get some packages from various locations to various new locations. There are 2 trucks and 1 airplane, as well as 4 packages. There are 4 locations across 2 cities. The locations are in cities as follows: l1-0 and l1-1 are in c1; l0-1 and l0-0 are in c0. Currently, a0 and p2 are at l1-0, t0 is at l0-0, t1 is at l1-1, p3 and p1 are in a0, p0 is in t1. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: p0 is at l0-0, p2 is at l1-0, p1 is at l1-0, and p3 is at l0-1. The available propositions are: (at ?obj ?loc) - ?obj is at ?loc and (in ?obj1 ?obj2) - ?obj1 is in ?obj2."
    question: "Generate a non-trivial fact landmark, one that does not hold in the initial state or goal."
