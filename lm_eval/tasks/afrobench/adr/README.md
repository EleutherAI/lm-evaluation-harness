# Automatic Diacritics Restoration (ADR)

Automatic Diacritics Restoration (ADR) is the task of restoring diacritical marks in text where they have been omitted or removed.
This process is essential for languages where diacritics alter pronunciation, meaning, or grammatical structure.
ADR requires the model to have a deep understanding of linguistic context, syntax, and semantics to accurately predict and reinsert the appropriate diacritics.

As part of this benchmark project, we utilise the mafand dataset to curate a dataset specifically for ADR. We focus on five languages: Gbomola, Fon, Igbo, Wolof, and Yoruba.
