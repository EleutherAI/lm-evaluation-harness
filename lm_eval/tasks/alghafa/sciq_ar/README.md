#Arabic SCIQ

### Paper

Original Title: `Crowdsourcing Multiple Choice Science Questions`

Original paper: [SCIQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06209)

It produces model suggestions for document selection and answer distractor choice which aid the human question
generation process.
With this method we have assembled SciQ, a dataset of 13.7K multiple choice science exam questions.
