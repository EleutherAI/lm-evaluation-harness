# [Think you have Solved Question Answering? Try ARC, the AI2 Reasoning Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05457)

## Abstract

The ARC dataset consists of 7,787 science exam questions drawn from a variety
of sources, including science questions provided under license by a research
partner affiliated with AI2. These are text-only, English language exam questions
that span several grade levels as indicated in the files. Each question has a
multiple choice structure (typically 4 answer options). The questions are sorted
into a Challenge Set of 2,590 “hard” questions (those that both a retrieval and
a co-occurrence method fail to answer correctly) and an Easy Set of 5,197 questions.
