# arc mt

arc mt is an implementation of tasks to support machine translated arc
challenge evals, to improve eval support across a number of additional
languages.

The main page for the effort is
[here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LumiOpen/arc_challenge_mt) and we will
include more data and analysis there.

Initial datasets include a number of European languages, and we plan to expand
more in the future.
