  - input: 'The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged
      in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.
      In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished
      above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.

      Options:

      (A) Amy finished last

      (B) Eli finished last

      (C) Eve finished last'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step.

      (1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".

      (2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".

      (3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli
      (below)".

      According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom
      of this list) is Eli.

      Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).'

      On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange
      book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the
      rightmost.

      Options:

      (A) The white book is the leftmost

      (B) The green book is the leftmost

      (C) The orange book is the leftmost'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step.

      (1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green
      ? (right)".

      (2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".

      (3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green
      orange (right)".

      According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.

      The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).'

      According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.

      The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).'
