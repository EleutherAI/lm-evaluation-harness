  - input: I have a blackberry, a clarinet, a nectarine, a plum, a strawberry, a banana,
      a flute, an orange, and a violin. How many fruits do I have?
    target: 'Let''s think step by step.

      We first identify the fruits on the list and include their quantity in parentheses:

      - blackberry (1)

      - nectarine (1)

      - plum (1)

      - strawberry (1)

      - banana (1)

      - orange (1)

      Now, let''s add the numbers in parentheses: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. So the
      answer is 6.'
  - input: I have an orange, a raspberry, two peaches, a blackberry, an apple, a grape,
      a nectarine, and three plums. How many fruits do I have?
    target: 'Let''s think step by step.

      We first identify the fruits on the list and include their quantity in parentheses:

      - orange (1)

      - raspberry (1)

      - peaches (2)

      - blackberry (1)

      - apple (1)

      - grape (1)

      - nectarine (1)

      - plums (3)

      Now, let''s add the numbers in parentheses: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 =
      11. So the answer is 11.'
  - input: I have a lettuce head, a head of broccoli, an onion, a stalk of celery,
      two carrots, a garlic, and a yam. How many vegetables do I have?
    target: 'Let''s think step by step.

      We first identify the vegetables on the list and include their quantity in parentheses:

      - lettuce (1)

      - broccoli (1)

      - onion (1)

      - celery (1)

      - carrots (2)

      - garlic (1)

      - yam (1)

      Now, let''s add the numbers in parentheses: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8. So
      the answer is 8.'
