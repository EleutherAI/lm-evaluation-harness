### Tasks

* [PubMedQA](https://pubmedqa.github.io/) - 1,000 expert-labeled Q&A pairs where a question and corresponding PubMed abstract as context is given and the a yes/maybe/no answer must be produced. Unlike the rest of the tasks in this suite, PubMedQA is a closed-domain Q&A task.
* [MedQA](https://github.com/jind11/MedQA) - US Medical License Exam (USMLE) questions with 4 or 5 possible answers. Typically, only the 4-option questions are used.
* [MedMCQA](https://medmcqa.github.io/) - 4-option multiple choice questions from Indian medical entrance examinations, >191k total questions.
* [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) - 4-option multiple choice exam questions from a variety of domains. The following 6 domains are utilized here:
	* Anatomy
	* Clinical Knowledge
	* College Medicine
	* Medical Genetics
	* Professional Medicine
	* College Biology

Note that MultiMedQA also includes some short-form and long-form Q&A tasks (LiveQA, MedicationQA, HealthSearchQA). Evaluation on these tasks is usually done by experts and is not typically performed automatically, and therefore is ignored here.
