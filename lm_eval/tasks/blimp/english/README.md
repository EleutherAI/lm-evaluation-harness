### Paper

Title: `BLiMP: A Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs for English`
Abstract: `https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00582`

BLiMP is a challenge set for evaluating what language models (LMs) know about
major grammatical phenomena in English. BLiMP consists of 67 sub-datasets, each
containing 1000 minimal pairs isolating specific contrasts in syntax, morphology,
or semantics. The data is automatically generated according to expert-crafted
grammars.

    abstract = { We introduce The Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (BLiMP),1 a challenge set for evaluating the linguistic knowledge of language models (LMs) on major grammatical phenomena in English. BLiMP consists of 67 individual datasets, each containing 1,000 minimal pairsâ€”that is, pairs of minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability and isolate specific phenomenon in syntax, morphology, or semantics. We generate the data according to linguist-crafted grammar templates, and human aggregate agreement with the labels is 96.4\%. We evaluate n-gram, LSTM, and Transformer (GPT-2 and Transformer-XL) LMs by observing whether they assign a higher probability to the acceptable sentence in each minimal pair. We find that state-of-the-art models identify morphological contrasts related to agreement reliably, but they struggle with some subtle semantic and syntactic phenomena, such as negative polarity items and extraction islands. }

List or describe tasks defined in this folder, and their names here:
* `task_name`: `1-sentence description of what this particular task does`
* `task_name2`: .....

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [ ] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [ ] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [ ] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [ ] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [ ] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
