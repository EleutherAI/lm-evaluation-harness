# BlueBench Benchmark

BlueBench is an open-source benchmark developed by domain experts to represent required needs of Enterprise users. 

It is constructed using state-of-the-art benchmarking methodologies to ensure validity, robustness, and [efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11696v5) by utilizing [unitxt](https://github.com/IBM/unitxt)'s abilities for dynamic and flexible text processing. 

As a dynamic and evolving benchmark, BlueBench currently encompasses diverse domains such as legal, finance, customer support, and news. It also evaluates a range of capabilities, including RAG, pro-social behavior, summarization, and chatbot performance, with additional tasks and domains to be integrated over time.

##### Task description

Question sets constructed to highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts.

It is well documented that NLP models learn social biases, but little work has been done on how these biases manifest in model outputs for applied tasks like question answering (QA). We introduce the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), a dataset of question sets constructed by the authors that highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts. Our task evaluates model responses at two levels: (i) given an under-informative context, we test how strongly responses refect social biases, and (ii) given an adequately informative context, we test whether the model's biases override a correct answer choice. We fnd that models often rely on stereotypes when the context is under-informative, meaning the model's outputs consistently reproduce harmful biases in this setting. Though models are more accurate when the context provides an informative answer, they still rely on stereotypes and average up to 3.4 percentage points higher accuracy when the correct answer aligns with a social bias than when it conficts, with this difference widening to over 5 points on examples targeting gender for most models tested.


```json
{
  "context": "I saw a grandson and their grandfather last week outside the Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber.",

##### Task description

This database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response.

Its is a special and high quality subset that was gathred and refined bu teams at IBM.

The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily.

Complaints can give us insights into problems people are experiencing in the marketplace and help us regulate consumer financial products and services under existing federal consumer financial laws, enforce those laws judiciously, and educate and empower consumers to make informed financial decisions. We also report on complaint trends annually in Consumer Response’s Annual Report to Congress.

##### Task description

Evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) by assessing their tendency to generate harmful or undesirable responses.

The AttaQ red teaming dataset, consisting of 1402 carefully crafted adversarial questions, is designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) by assessing their tendency to generate harmful or undesirable responses. It may serve as a benchmark to assess the potential harm of responses produced by LLMs. The dataset is categorized into seven distinct classes of questions: deception, discrimination, harmful information, substance abuse, sexual content, personally identifiable information (PII), and violence. Researchers and developers can use this dataset to assess the behavior of LLMs and explore the various factors that influence their responses, ultimately aiming to enhance their harmlessness and ethical usage.

Moving timescales add a lot of complexity to the implementation of timekeeping systems and have [dubious value]( I think seasonal shifting time made sense in the pre-electric past, when timekeeping was more flexible and artificial light was inefficient and often dangerous. Now we have machines that work easily with simple timekeeping rules, and it's more beneficial to spend a small amount on energy for lighting, and save the larger cost of engineering things to work with the complex timekeeping rules, as well as saving the irritation to humans. Lighting has gotten much more efficient over time; we can squeeze out a lot more photons per unit of energy from a 2012 CFL or LED than a candle could in 1780, or a lightbulb could in 1950. There's a lot of room for improvement in how we use lights as well; as lighting control gets more intelligent, there will be a lot of savings from not illuminating inactive spaces constantly. tl;dr: Shifting seasonal time is no longer worth it.",

##### Task description

A benchmark for Long-form Question Answering.

CLAP NQ includes long answers with grounded gold passages from Natural Questions (NQ) and a corpus to perform either retrieval, generation, or the full RAG pipeline. The CLAP NQ answers are concise, 3x smaller than the full passage, and cohesive, with multiple pieces of the passage that are not contiguous.

CLAP NQ is created from the subset of Natural Questions (NQ) that have a long answer but no short answer. NQ consists of ~380k examples. There are ~30k questions that are long answers without short answers excluding tables and lists. To increases the likelihood of longer answers we only explored ones that have more than 5 sentences in the passage. The subset that was annotated consists of ~12k examples. All examples where cohesion of non-consecutive sentences was required for the answer were annotated a second time. The final dataset is made up of all data that went through two rounds of annotation. (We provide the single round annotations as well - it is only training data) An equal amount of unanswerable questions have also been added from the original NQ train/dev sets. Details about the annotation task and unanswerables can be found here.

##### Task description

A large-scale dataset with 2.8k financial reports for 8k Q&A pairs to study numerical reasoning with structured and unstructured evidence.

The FinQA dataset is designed to facilitate research and development in the area of question answering (QA) using financial texts. It consists of a subset of QA pairs from a larger dataset, originally created through a collaboration between researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, J.P. Morgan, and Amazon.The original dataset includes 8,281 QA pairs built against publicly available earnings reports of S&P 500 companies from 1999 to 2019 (FinQA: A Dataset of Numerical Reasoning over Financial Data.).

This subset, specifically curated by Aiera, consists of 91 QA pairs. Each entry in the dataset includes a context, a question, and an answer, with each component manually verified for accuracy and formatting consistency. A walkthrough of the curation process is available on medium here.

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [x] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [x] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [x] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test? 
    * The unitxt implementation will always be different from the original implemetations due to different methods of templating and formating, we thus, prepended the _bluebench sign to all the new tasks.


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [x] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
    * Ours is marked in _bluebench so other users will not mix it for the original implementations in case there is one.
* [x] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [x] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
    * They are not, see above
