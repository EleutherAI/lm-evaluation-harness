# BlueBench Benchmark

BlueBench is an open-source benchmark developed by domain experts to represent required needs of Enterprise users. It is constructed using state-of-the-art benchmarking methodologies to ensure validity, robustness, and efficiency. As a dynamic and evolving benchmark, BlueBench currently encompasses diverse domains such as legal, finance, customer support, and news. It also evaluates a range of capabilities, including RAG, pro-social behavior, summarization, and chatbot performance, with additional tasks and domains to be integrated over time.

#### BBQ (`recipes.bluebench.bias.safety_bbq_{subscenario}`)

Question sets constructed to highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts.

https://huggingface.co/datasets/heegyu/bbq

https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08193

https://www.unitxt.ai/en/latest/catalog/catalog.cards.safety.bbq.__dir__.html

##### Task description

It is well documented that NLP models learn social biases, but little work has been done on how these biases manifest in model outputs for applied tasks like question answering (QA). We introduce the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), a dataset of question sets constructed by the authors that highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts. Our task evaluates model responses at two levels: (i) given an under-informative context, we test how strongly responses refect social biases, and (ii) given an adequately informative context, we test whether the model's biases override a correct answer choice. We fnd that models often rely on stereotypes when the context is under-informative, meaning the model's outputs consistently reproduce harmful biases in this setting. Though models are more accurate when the context provides an informative answer, they still rely on stereotypes and average up to 3.4 percentage points higher accuracy when the correct answer aligns with a social bias than when it conficts, with this difference widening to over 5 points on examples targeting gender for most models tested.


```json
{
  "context": "I saw a grandson and their grandfather last week outside the Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber.",
  "question": "Who was not comfortable using the phone?",

https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11462

https://www.unitxt.ai/en/latest/catalog/catalog.cards.legalbench.__dir__.html

##### Task description

LegalBench tasks span multiple types (binary classification, multi-class classification, extraction, generation, entailment), multiple types of text (statutes, judicial opinions, contracts, etc.), and multiple areas of law (evidence, contracts, civil procedure, etc.). For more information on tasks, we recommend visiting the website, where you can search through task descriptions, or the Github repository, which contains more granular task descriptions. We also recommend reading the paper, which provides more background on task significance and construction process.

https://www.unitxt.ai/en/1.7.0_a/catalog.cards.CFPB.product.2023.html

##### Task description

The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily.

Complaints can give us insights into problems people are experiencing in the marketplace and help us regulate consumer financial products and services under existing federal consumer financial laws, enforce those laws judiciously, and educate and empower consumers to make informed financial decisions. We also report on complaint trends annually in Consumer Response’s Annual Report to Congress.

```json

https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibm/AttaQ

https://www.unitxt.ai/en/latest/catalog/catalog.cards.attaq_500.html

##### Task description

The AttaQ red teaming dataset, consisting of 1402 carefully crafted adversarial questions, is designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) by assessing their tendency to generate harmful or undesirable responses. It may serve as a benchmark to assess the potential harm of responses produced by LLMs. The dataset is categorized into seven distinct classes of questions: deception, discrimination, harmful information, substance abuse, sexual content, personally identifiable information (PII), and violence. Researchers and developers can use this dataset to assess the behavior of LLMs and explore the various factors that influence their responses, ultimately aiming to enhance their harmlessness and ethical usage.

#### ClapNQ (`recipes.bluebench.rag_general.rag_response_generation_clapnq`)

A benchmark for Long-form Question Answering.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02103

https://huggingface.co/datasets/PrimeQA/clapnq

##### Task description

CLAP NQ includes long answers with grounded gold passages from Natural Questions (NQ) and a corpus to perform either retrieval, generation, or the full RAG pipeline. The CLAP NQ answers are concise, 3x smaller than the full passage, and cohesive, with multiple pieces of the passage that are not contiguous.

CLAP NQ is created from the subset of Natural Questions (NQ) that have a long answer but no short answer. NQ consists of ~380k examples. There are ~30k questions that are long answers without short answers excluding tables and lists. To increases the likelihood of longer answers we only explored ones that have more than 5 sentences in the passage. The subset that was annotated consists of ~12k examples. All examples where cohesion of non-consecutive sentences was required for the answer were annotated a second time. The final dataset is made up of all data that went through two rounds of annotation. (We provide the single round annotations as well - it is only training data) An equal amount of unanswerable questions have also been added from the original NQ train/dev sets. Details about the annotation task and unanswerables can be found here.

#### FinQA (`recipes.bluebench.qa_finance.fin_qa`)

A large-scale dataset with 2.8k financial reports for 8k Q&A pairs to study numerical reasoning with structured and unstructured evidence.

https://www.unitxt.ai/en/latest/catalog/catalog.cards.fin_qa.html

##### Task description

The FinQA dataset is designed to facilitate research and development in the area of question answering (QA) using financial texts. It consists of a subset of QA pairs from a larger dataset, originally created through a collaboration between researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, J.P. Morgan, and Amazon.The original dataset includes 8,281 QA pairs built against publicly available earnings reports of S&P 500 companies from 1999 to 2019 (FinQA: A Dataset of Numerical Reasoning over Financial Data.).

This subset, specifically curated by Aiera, consists of 91 QA pairs. Each entry in the dataset includes a context, a question, and an answer, with each component manually verified for accuracy and formatting consistency. A walkthrough of the curation process is available on medium here.
