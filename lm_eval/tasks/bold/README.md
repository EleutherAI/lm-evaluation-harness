Title: `Bias in Open-ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD)`

Abstract: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11718

Bias in Open-ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD) is a dataset to evaluate fairness in open-ended language generation in English language. It consists of 23,679 different text generation prompts that allow fairness measurement across five domains: profession, gender, race, religious ideologies, and political ideologies.

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [ ] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [ ] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [ ] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [ ] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [ ] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
