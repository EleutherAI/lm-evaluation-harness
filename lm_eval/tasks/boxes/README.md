Title: `Entity Tracking in Language Models`

Abstract: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02363`

Keeping track of how states of entities change as a text or dialog unfolds is a key prerequisite to discourse understanding.
Yet, there have been few systematic investigations into the ability of large language models (LLMs) to track discourse entities.
In this work, a task probing to what extent a language model can infer the final state of an entity given an English description
of the initial state and a series of state-changing operations is presented.
