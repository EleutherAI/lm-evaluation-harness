Title: Atlas-Chat: Adapting Large Language Models for Low-Resource Moroccan Arabic Dialect

Abstract: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17912)

DarijaHellaSwag is a challenging multiple-choice benchmark designed to evaluate machine reading comprehension and commonsense reasoning in Moroccan Darija. It is a translated version of the HellaSwag validation set, which presents scenarios where models must choose the most plausible continuation of a passage from four options.

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:

* [X] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [X] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [X] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?

If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:

* [ ] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [ ] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
