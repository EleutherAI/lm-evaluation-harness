# Dharma2

Dharma2 is useful for quick evaluation, as it's small (300 questions) and wide (many kinds of tasks & topics).

It is created by subsampling 300 random questions from the datasets below, and unifying their format.

The subsampling was done by [pharaouk](https://github.com/pharaouk/) with their [dharma repository](https://github.com/pharaouk/dharma).

The datasets are:
- mmlu
- arc_c
- arc_e
- agieval
- boolq
- obqa
- truthfulqa
- winogrande
