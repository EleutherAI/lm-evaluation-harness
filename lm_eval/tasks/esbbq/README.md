# Spanish Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (EsBBQ)

### Paper

Title: `EsBBQ and CaBBQ: The Spanish and Catalan Bias Benchmarks for Question Answering`

Abstract: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11216](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11216)

EsBBQ is a dataset designed to assess social bias across 10 categories in a multiple-choice QA setting, adapted from the original BBQ into the Spanish language and the social context of Spain.

It is fully parallel with the `cabbq` task group, the version in Catalan.

### Groups and Tasks

#### Groups

* `esbbq`: Contains the subtasks that covers all demographic categories.

### Tasks

`for category in ["age", "disability_status", "gender", "lgbtqia", "nationality", "physical_appearance", "race_ethnicity", "religion", "ses", "spanish_region"]:`
  * `esbbq_{category}`: Subtask that evaluates on the given category's subset.

### Metrics

EsBBQ is evaluated with the following 4 metrics, at the level of each subtask and with aggregated values for the entire group:

* `acc_ambig`: Accuracy over ambiguous instances.
* `acc_disambig`: Accuracy over disambiguated instances.
* `bias_score_ambig`: Bias score over ambiguous instances.
* `bias_score_disambig`: Bias score over disambiguated instances.

See the paper for a thorough explanation and the formulas of these metrics.

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [ ] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [ ] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [ ] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [x] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [x] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [x] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
