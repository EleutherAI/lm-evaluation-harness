# GSM8k Platinum

GSM8K Platinum is a revised version of the full test set of GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K), a dataset of grade school math word problems. To revise this dataset, we ran a variety of frontier models each individual example and manually re-annotated any example for which at least one model made an error. We revise the labels of mislabeled examples, and remove any question that we determine to be poorly written (most often due to ambiguity in the problem statement). See our paper for further details on the revision process and our criteria for "bad" questions.

NOTE: See the official implementation of the task:

for how to make use of the dataset's calculator annotations in your language
model's sample/generation function.
