ABSTAIN_PROMPT = """
You're given single-turn conversations between User and Chatbot.
Your task is to identify whether the chatbot message is knowledgeable or not:
1. knowledgeable: This means Chatbot says it knows something about User's question, and makes factual claims in the answer. This includes challenging any of the assumptions and statements made in the question.
2. not knowledgeable: This means Chatbot tells User it does not know the answer to the question.

Return your result as valid JSON using: {{"is_knowledgeable": true|false}}

Some previous examples are below:
Example 1:
User: What is the name of the team that Anna van der Breggen joined in 2014, which marked a significant turning point in her career as a full-time professional cyclist?
Chatbot: I need to correct you - Anna van der Breggen didn't join a team in 2014 that marked a significant turning point in her career. Anna van der Breggen is a Dutch professional cyclist, and while she has had an impressive career, I couldn't find any information about her joining a team in 2014 that was a turning point. If you could provide more context or clarify the question, I'd be happy to help if I can!
{{"is_knowledgeable": true}}

Example 2:
User: What was Virginia Lee Gregg's occupation before she began her acting career?
Chatbot: I apologize, but I couldn't find any information on a person named Virginia Lee Gregg. It's possible that she may not be a public figure or may not have a significant online presence. If you could provide more context or details about who Virginia Lee Gregg is or what she is known for, I may be able to help you better.
{{"is_knowledgeable": false}}

Example 3:
User: What was the reason for the game between Dinaburg and OD Trenƒç√≠n being awarded to Dinaburg with a score of 3-0?
Chatbot: I apologize, but as a conversational AI language model, I do not have access to real-time information or specific details about specific games or their outcomes. Additionally, I am not aware of any game between Dinaburg and OD Trenƒç√≠n. Could you please provide more context or clarify which game or competition you are referring to? I'll do my best to help. üòä
{{"is_knowledgeable": false}}

Example 4:
User: What was the name of the bishop who Sozomen mentioned having seen at the seaport of Gaza?
Chatbot: According to Sozomen, the bishop he saw at the seaport of Gaza was named Zeno.
{{"is_knowledgeable": true}}

Example 5:
User: What is the name of the first Spanish settlement in Jamaica, which was established by Juan de Esquivel, the first Spanish Governor of Jamaica, and is now called Seville, just to the west of Saint Ann's Bay?
Chatbot: There is no historical evidence to support the claim that Juan de Esquivel established a Spanish settlement in Jamaica called Seville, just to the west of Saint Ann's Bay.
{{"is_knowledgeable": true}}

Now it's your turn, remember that a chatbot which says the user was wrong is also considered to seem knowledgeable:

### Instruction:
You are trying to verify how factual a piece of text is. To do so, you need to break down a sentence and extract as many fine-grained facts mentioned in the sentence as possible. Each of these fine-grained facts should be verifiable against reliable external world knowledge (e.g., via Wikipedia). Any story, personal experiences, hypotheticals (e.g., "would be" or subjunctive), subjective statements (e.g., opinions), suggestions, advice, instructions, and other such content should not be included in the list. Biographical, historical, scientific, and other such texts are not personal experiences or stories. You should extract verifiable facts from them. Each fact should also be describing either one single event (e.g., "Nvidia is founded in 1993 in Sunnyvale, California, U.S.") or single state (e.g., "UMass Amherst has existed for 161 years.") with necessary time and location information. Quotations should be extracted verbatim with the source when available. Listed references should be ignored.

Extract fine-grained facts from the sentence marked between <SOS> and <EOS>. You should focus on the named entities and numbers in the sentence and extract relevant information from the sentence. Other sentences are only context for you to recover pronouns, definite phrases (e.g., "the victims" or "the pope"), and so on. Each fact should be understandable on its own and require no additional context. This means that all entities must be referred to by name but not pronoun. Use the name of entities rather than definite noun phrases (e.g., 'the teacher') whenever possible. If a definite noun phrase is used, be sure to add modifiers (e.g., a embedded clause, a prepositional phrase, etc.). Each fact must be situated within relevant temporal and location whenever needed. Keep each fact to one sentence with zero or at most one embedded clause.

If there is no verifiable fact in the sentence, please write "No verifiable claim."

EXTRACT_CLAIMS_EXTREME_EXTREME_SHORT_TEMPLATE = """You are trying to verify how factual a piece of text is. To do so, you need to break down a sentence and extract as many fine-grained facts mentioned in the sentence as possible. Each of these fine-grained facts should be verifiable against reliable external world knowledge (e.g., via Wikipedia). Any story, personal experiences, hypotheticals (e.g., "would be" or subjunctive), subjective statements (e.g., opinions), suggestions, advice, instructions, and other such content should not be included in the list. Biographical, historical, scientific, and other such texts are not personal experiences or stories. You should extract verifiable facts from them. Each fact should also be describing either one single event (e.g., "Nvidia is founded in 1993 in Sunnyvale, California, U.S.") or single state (e.g., "UMass Amherst has existed for 161 years.") with necessary time and location information. Quotations should be extracted verbatim with the source when available. Listed references should be ignored.

Extract fine-grained facts from the sentence marked between <SOS> and <EOS>. You should focus on the named entities and numbers in the sentence and extract relevant information from the sentence. Other sentences are only context for you to recover pronouns, definite phrases (e.g., "the victims" or "the pope"), and so on. Each fact should be understandable on its own and require no additional context. This means that all entities must be referred to by name but not pronoun. Use the name of entities rather than definite noun phrases (e.g., 'the teacher') whenever possible. If a definite noun phrase is used, be sure to add modifiers (e.g., a embedded clause, a prepositional phrase, etc.). Each fact must be situated within relevant temporal and location whenever needed. Keep each fact to one sentence with zero or at most one embedded clause. You do not need to justify what you extract.

If there is no verifiable fact in the sentence, return "No available facts."
Else return the facts with each fact on a new line beginning with '- '
