Icelandic WinoGrande is a manually translated and localized version of the English-language WinoGrande dataset, designed to be 'a new and challenging benchmark for commonsense reasoning and natural language understanding' in Icelandic [(Sn√¶bjarnarson et al., 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.464/).

**Implementation Note:** The original dataset is designed for evaluation on a BERT model. Following the evaluation method used for the original (English-language) WinoGrande on the Harness (see information [here](../winogrande/README.md)), this evaluation uses partial scoring as described by [Trinh & Le (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02847) to allow evaluation on autoregressive models.

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [x] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [x] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [x] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?
