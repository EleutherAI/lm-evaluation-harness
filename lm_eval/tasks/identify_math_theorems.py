Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03300.pdf

The Hendryck's Test is a benchmark that measured a text model’s multitask accuracy.
The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer
science, law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess
extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. By comprehensively evaluating
the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and professional understanding,
Hendryck's Test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify
important shortcomings.
