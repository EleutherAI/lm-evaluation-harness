INCLUDE is a comprehensive knowledge- and reasoning-centric benchmark across 44 languages that evaluates multilingual LLMs for performance in the actual language environments where they would be deployed. It contains 22,637 4-option multiple-choice-questions (MCQ) extracted from academic and professional exams, covering 57 topics, including regional knowledge.
