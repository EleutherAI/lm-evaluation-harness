Title: `LegalBench: A Collaboratively Built Benchmark for Measuring Legal Reasoning in Large Language Models`

Abstract: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11462

The LegalBench project is an open science effort to collaboratively curate tasks for evaluating legal reasoning in English large language models (LLMs). LegalBench tasks have been assembled through a unique crowdsourcing effort within the legal community. Individuals and organizations from various legal backgrounds—lawyers, computational legal practitioners, law professors, and legal impact labs—have contributed tasks they find “interesting” or “useful.” Interesting tasks require a type of reasoning that the contributor considers worth measuring, such as tasks frequently performed by law students during assessments. Useful tasks relate to practical applications of LLMs, like contractual analysis. LegalBench also includes tasks derived from existing legal benchmarks (e.g., CUAD), providing a single platform for evaluating a wide range of legal tasks.

In its entirety, the benchmark consists of 162 tasks gathered from 40 contributors. However, in `lm-evaluation-harness` we only include 5 core subtasks: abercrombie, corporate lobbying, function of decision section, international citizenship questions, and proa.
