Title: `MLQA: Evaluating Cross-lingual Extractive Question Answering`

Abstract: `https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07475`

MLQA (MultiLingual Question Answering) is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-lingual question answering performance.
MLQA consists of over 5K extractive QA instances (12K in English) in SQuAD format in seven languages - English, Arabic,
German, Spanish, Hindi, Vietnamese and Simplified Chinese. MLQA is highly parallel, with QA instances parallel between
4 different languages on average

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [x] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [x] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [x] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [ ] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [ ] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
