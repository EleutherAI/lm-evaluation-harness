"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about anatomy.\n\
  \nQ: Which of the following is the body cavity that contains the pituitary gland?\n\
  (A) Abdominal (B) Cranial (C) Pleural (D) Spinal\nA: Let's think step by step. We\
  \ refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step\
  \ by step. The pituitary gland is the major endocrine gland attached to the base\
  \ of the brain, and it is contained in the Cranial cavity. The answer is (B).\n\n\
  Q: Which of these branches of the trigeminal nerve contain somatic motor processes?\n\
  (A) The supraorbital nerve (B) The infraorbital nerve (C) The mental nerve (D) None\
  \ of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy\
  \ for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. \nWe know the following: (A)\
  \ The supraorbital nerve (also known as the frontal nerve) is the largest branch\
  \ of the ophthalmic nerve and branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.\
  \ (B) The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal\
  \ nerve. (C) The mental nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal\
  \ nerve. Because all these nerves are purely sensory nerves and do not contain any\
  \ somatic motor processes. Therefore, the answer should be none of the above, which\
  \ is (D). The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In Angle's Class II Div 2 occlusion there is\n\
  (A) excess overbite of the upper lateral incisors. (B) negative overjet of the upper\
  \ central incisors. (C) excess overjet of the upper lateral incisors. (D) excess\
  \ overjet of the upper central incisors.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer\
  \ to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step.\
  \ This is a question related to anatomy and orthodontics. Excess overjet is associated\
  \ with Class II occlusions; therefore, we can safely eliminate (B) from the list,\
  \ as negative overjet is often associated with Class III occlusions. Now, we need\
  \ to determine the location of the excess overjet, and that would be the upper (maxillary)\
  \ lateral incisors. Only (C) has the correct information. The answer is (C).\n\n\
  Q: The pleura\n(A) have no sensory innervation. (B) are separated by a 2 mm space.\
  \ (C) extend into the neck. (D) are composed of respiratory epithelium.\nA: Let's\
  \ think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s\
  \ solve this problem step by step. First, recall that the pleura refers to the thin\
  \ layer of tissue that covers the lungs and lines the interior wall of the chest\
  \ cavity. Now, let’s look at each option:\nOption (A): “The pleura have no sensory\
  \ innervation.” This information is not correct. The pleura do have a sensory innervation.\n\
  Option (B): “The pleura are separated by a 2 mm space.” This information is not\
  \ correct. There is a very thin “potential” space between the layers of the pleura;\
  \ however, it is typically filled with serous pleural fluid. \nOption (C): “The\
  \ pleura extend into the neck.” This information is actuakky true. The cervical\
  \ pleura, also known as the dome of the pleuradome of the pleura, lines the extendsiton\
  \ of the pleural cavity into the neck.\nOption (D): “The pleura are composed of\
  \ respiratory epithelium.” This information is not correct. The pleaura are composed\
  \ of connective tissue (CT).\nBecause (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect, (D) is\
  \ the only correct answer. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What is the embryological origin\
  \ of the hyoid bone?\n(A) The first pharyngeal arch (B) The first and second pharyngeal\
  \ arches (C) The second pharyngeal arch (D) The second and third pharyngeal arches\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help.\
  \ Let’s solve this problem step by step. The hyoid bone, which is also known as\
  \ the hyooid, is a a small U-shaped bone located in the anterior neck. In its resting\
  \ position, it lies between the ase of the mandible and the third cervical vertebrae.\
  \ We know that the second and the third pharyngeal arches give rise to the horns\
  \ of the hyoid bone; therefore, the embryological origin of the hyoid bone are the\
  \ second and the third pharyngeal arches—this information is covered in the last\
  \ option (D). Therefore, we conclude that (D) must be the correct answer. The answer\
  \ is (D).\n\n"
