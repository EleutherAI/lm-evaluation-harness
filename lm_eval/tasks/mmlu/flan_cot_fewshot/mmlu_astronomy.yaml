"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\
  \nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper\
  \ belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like\
  \ the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random\
  \ directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\
  \ (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids\
  \ like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid\
  \ belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar\
  \ system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period\
  \ comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend\
  \ to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer\
  \ is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate\
  \ this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder\
  \ since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is\
  \ lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D)\
  \ It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If\
  \ we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck\
  \ is by Newton’s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A),\
  \ (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn’t matter that it’s on Mars, and (D) is\
  \ the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter\
  \ of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light\
  \ can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more\
  \ (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount\
  \ of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with\
  \ diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm\
  \ and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer\
  \ is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A)\
  \ A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\
  \ (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\
  \ (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough\
  \ gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented\
  \ material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step.\
  \ The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids\
  \ between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by\
  \ the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the\
  \ strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low\
  \ density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not\
  \ correct since it’s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed,\
  \ and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from\
  \ forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\
  \nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized\
  \ (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer\
  \ wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient\
  \ lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface\
  \ altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by\
  \ step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering\
  \ off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look\
  \ red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface\
  \ would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red\
  \ due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust.\
  \ So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\n"
