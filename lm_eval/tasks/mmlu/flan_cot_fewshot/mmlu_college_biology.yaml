"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college\
  \ biology.\n\nQ: Which of the following represents an accurate statement concerning\
  \ arthropods?\n(A) They possess an exoskeleton composed primarily of peptidoglycan.\
  \ (B) They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart. (C) They are\
  \ members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse\
  \ habitats and nutrition sources. (D) They lack paired, jointed appendages.\nA:\
  \ Let's think step by step. Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane\
  \ of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of\
  \ chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a\
  \ highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages,\
  \ which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open\
  \ circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In a\
  \ given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely\
  \ recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,\
  \ which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the\
  \ b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?\n(A) 1/400 (B) 19/400 (C)\
  \ 20/400 (D) 38/400\nA: Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg\
  \ Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the\
  \ dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$,\
  \ and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and\
  \ heterozygous individuals, respectively. â€‹The frequency of the recessive allele\
  \ (q) is $\\sqrt{\frac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency\
  \ of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The\
  \ number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals\
  \ times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400.\
  \ The answer is (D).\n\nQ: According to the pressure-flow model of movement of phloem\
  \ contents, photosynthate movement from source to sink is driven by\n(A) an ATP-dependent\
  \ pressure-flow pump (B) a water-pressure potential gradient (C) transpiration (D)\
  \ apoplastic diffusion\nA: Let's think step by step. It is a gradient in water pressure\
  \ that induces the movement of phloem content, which refers to answer (B). The mechanism\
  \ of movement does not rely on metabolism, which rules out (A). Transpiration refers\
  \ to the exhalation of water vapor through plant stomata, and is also not related,\
  \ which rules out (C). While the apoplastic pathway is one of two main pathways\
  \ for water transport in plants, it is not central to the pressure flow model, which\
  \ rules out (D). The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following contain DNA sequences\
  \ required for the segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis?\n(A) Telomeres\
  \ (B) Centromeres (C) Nucleosomes (D) Spliceosomes\nA: Let's think step by step.\
  \ The genetic material in Telomeres is not used, which rules out (A). Nucleosomes\
  \ are the repeating subunit that comprises chromatin packed in a cell nucleus, and\
  \ do not specifically refer to DNA sequences necessary for segregating chromosomes\
  \ in cell division, which rules out (C). A spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein\
  \ that removes introns from transcribed pre-mRNA rather than governing chromosome\
  \ segregation. Centromeres are directly responsible for segregating chromosomes\
  \ in cell division. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: The presence of homologous structures\
  \ in two different organisms, such as the humerus in the front limb of a human and\
  \ a bird, indicates that\n(A) the human and bird are polyphyletic species (B) a\
  \ human's and bird's evolution is convergent (C) the human and bird belong to a\
  \ clade (D) the human and bird developed by analogy\nA: Let's think step by step.\
  \ Polyphyletic species are organisms that are grouped due to having similar characteristics\
  \ but which do not have a common ancestor. This is not the case for humans and birds,\
  \ which rules out (A). Convergent evolution refers to the indepdendent development\
  \ of similar features in different species at different periods, which is also not\
  \ the case for humans and birds, which rules out (B). Analogy refers to the superficial\
  \ resemblance of structures that have different origins, which is not the case for\
  \ the human and bird forearms, which rules out (D). Humans and birds do belong to\
  \ the same clade - a group of organisms composed of a common ancestor. The answer\
  \ is (C).\n\n"
