"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college\
  \ chemistry.\n\nQ: 3 Cl−(aq) + 4 CrO_4^2−(aq) + 23 H+(aq) → 3 HClO2(aq) + 4 Cr3+(aq)\
  \ + 10 H2O(l). In the reaction shown above, Cl−(aq) behaves as\n(A) an acid (B)\
  \ a base (C) a catalyst (D) a reducing agent\nA: Let's think step by step. A molecule\
  \ that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas\
  \ a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule.\
  \ Neither of these is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and\
  \ (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself\
  \ undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C). Instead,\
  \ the $Cl^{-} molecules carry a negative charge, which they donate in the reaction\
  \ to form 3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing agent, or (D). The answer\
  \ is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements about the lanthanide elements\
  \ is NOT true?\n(A) The most common oxidation state for the lanthanide elements\
  \ is +3. (B) Lanthanide complexes often have high coordination numbers (> 6). (C)\
  \ All of the lanthanide elements react with aqueous acid to liberate hydrogen. (D)\
  \ The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements increase across the period from La\
  \ to Lu.\nA: Let's think step by step. The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements\
  \ in fact decrease across the period from La to Lu. Options (A), (B), and (C) are\
  \ all true. This means that only (D) is NOT true. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which\
  \ of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability,\
  \ from lowest to highest?\n(A) PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4 (B) PbH4 < SnH4 <\
  \ CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 (C) CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 (D) CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 <\
  \ SnH4 < SiH4\nA: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides\
  \ decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements\
  \ in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing\
  \ thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (A). The\
  \ answer is (A).\n\nQ: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution\
  \ of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.\n\
  (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 6 (D) 24 (E) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic\
  \ resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the\
  \ hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = \nrac{1}{2}$) which will\
  \ split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the\
  \ interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore\
  \ $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (E).\n\n"
