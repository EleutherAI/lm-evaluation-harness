"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college\
  \ medicine.\n\nQ: An expected side effect of creatine supplementation is:\n(A) muscle\
  \ weakness. (B) gain in body mass. (C) muscle cramps. (D) loss of electrolytes.\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help.\
  \ Creatine supplementation is a dietary supplement that results in body mass gain.\
  \ The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not a true statement?\n(A)\
  \ Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate (B) Elite\
  \ endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles\
  \ (C) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration\
  \ (D) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\nA: Let's think\
  \ step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let’s solve\
  \ this step by step and go over each choice: \n(A) “Muscle glycogen is broken down\
  \ enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate”: This is a correct statement.\n(B) “Elite\
  \ endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles”:\
  \ This is a correct statement.\n(C) “Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance\
  \ of the blood glucose concentration”: This is a correct statement. \n(D) “Insulin\
  \ promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body”: This is not a correct statement,\
  \ because insulin promotes glucose uptake by the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle,\
  \ but not all tissues. For instance, the tissues in the brain and red blood cells\
  \ are not affected by insulin. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A high school science teacher\
  \ fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70\
  \ atm, and the room temperature is 25°C. Which two variables will both increase\
  \ the pressure of the system, if all other variables are held constant?\n(A) Increasing\
  \ temperature, increasing moles of gas (B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume\
  \ (C) Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature (D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing\
  \ volume\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine\
  \ for help. The relevant equation for this is the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. To increase\
  \ the pressure of the system (P), then either n (number of moles of the gas) or\
  \ T (temperature) have to increase. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: In a genetic test of\
  \ a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that has X-linked recessive transmission.\
  \ Which of the following statements is likely true regarding the pedigree of this\
  \ disorder?\n(A) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder. (B)\
  \ Females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family. (C) All\
  \ daughters of an affected male will be affected. (D) There will be equal distribution\
  \ of males and females affected.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on medicine for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let's recall first\
  \ that females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome.\
  \ This is an important fact we need to know before answering this question. \nBecause\
  \ a male can only pass his only one X chromosome to a daughter, if he is affected\
  \ by this rare genetic disorder, then we know for sure that he will pass this rare\
  \ genetic disorder to all his future-born daughters. Therefore, “(C): All daughters\
  \ of an affected male will be affected” is a correct statement. The answer is (C).\n\
  \nQ: Glucose is transported into the muscle cell:\n(A) via protein transporters\
  \ called GLUT4. (B) only in the presence of insulin. (C) via hexokinase. (D) via\
  \ monocarbylic acid transporters.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on medicine for help. Glucose (also known as the blood sugar) is the\
  \ main sugar found in the human body. It is transported into the muscle cell via\
  \ diffusion through protein transporters called GLUT4. The answer is (A).\n\n"
