"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college\
  \ physics.\n\nQ: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated\
  \ by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification\
  \ of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. In\
  \ a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses\
  \ must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must\
  \ add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal\
  \ length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two\
  \ focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: The muon decays with a characteristic\
  \ lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron\
  \ antineutrino. The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a\
  \ single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy\
  \ and momentum (D) lepton number\nA: Let's think step by step. Lepton number must\
  \ be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons.\
  \ If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number\
  \ would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation. The answer is\
  \ (D).\n\nQ: One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A\
  \ is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional\
  \ area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0\
  \ volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0\
  \ volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n\
  (A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a\
  \ simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times\
  \ that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the\
  \ potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V. The answer is\
  \ (A).\n\nQ: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated\
  \ by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification\
  \ of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. In\
  \ a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses\
  \ must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must\
  \ add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal\
  \ length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two\
  \ focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic\
  \ processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the\
  \ heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant\
  \ pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can\
  \ go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However,\
  \ if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work\
  \ is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes\
  \ into the internal energy. The answer is (B).\n\n"
