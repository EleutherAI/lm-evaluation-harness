"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about computer\
  \ security.\n\nQ: SHA-1 has a message digest of\n(A) 160 bits (B) 512 bits (C) 628\
  \ bits (D) 820 bits\nA: Let's think step by step. Since SHA-1 is a hash function\
  \ which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, its message\
  \ digest is 160 bits. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: _____________ can modify data on\
  \ your system – so that your system doesn’t run correctly or you can no longer access\
  \ specific data, or it may even ask for ransom in order to give your access.\n(A)\
  \ IM – Trojans (B) Backdoor Trojans (C) Trojan-Downloader (D) Ransom Trojan\nA:\
  \ Let's think step by step. The system is asking for trojans, which are for ransom,\
  \ which means ransom trojan. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: What is ethical hacking?\n\
  (A) \"Hacking\" ethics so they justify unintended selfish behavior (B) Hacking systems\
  \ (e.g., during penetration testing) to expose vulnerabilities so they can be fixed,\
  \ rather than exploited (C) Hacking into systems run by those whose ethics you disagree\
  \ with (D) A slang term for rapid software development, e.g., as part of hackathons\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. Ethical hacking is a process of detecting vulnerabilities\
  \ in an application, system, or organization's infrastructure that an attacker can\
  \ use to exploit an individual or organization. They use this process to prevent\
  \ cyberattacks and security breaches by lawfully hacking into the systems and looking\
  \ for weak points. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: The ____________ is anything which your\
  \ search engine cannot search.\n(A) Haunted web (B) World Wide Web (C) Surface web\
  \ (D) Deep Web\nA: Let's think step by step. The search engine searches on the Surface\
  \ Web, which is the portion of the world wide web which is visible so (B,C) are\
  \ wrong. The Haunted Web doesn’t correspond to an internet concept. The Deep Web\
  \ is the part of the World Wide Web which is not indexed. The answer is (D).\n\n\
  Q: Exploitation of the Heartbleed bug permits\n(A) overwriting cryptographic keys\
  \ in memory (B) a kind of code injection (C) a read outside bounds of a buffer (D)\
  \ a format string attack\nA: Let's think step by step. The Heartbleed Bug is a serious\
  \ vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. Heartbleed\
  \ resulted from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the\
  \ implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension. The vulnerability was classified\
  \ as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be\
  \ allowed. The answer is (C).\n\n"
