"description": "\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about\
  \ conceptual physics.\n\nQ: Colors in a soap bubble result from light\n(A) converted\
  \ to a different frequency (B) deflection (C) interference (D) polarization\nA:\
  \ Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the\
  \ two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or\
  \ destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors\
  \ being visible. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Compared with the mass of a uranium atom\
  \ undergoing fission, the combined masses of the products after fission are\n(A)\
  \ less (B) more (C) the same (D) zero\nA: Let's think step by step. Fission releases\
  \ energy, which comes from the rest mass of its initial nucleus. Thus the mass of\
  \ the products is less than the mass of the reactant uranium nucleus. The answer\
  \ is (A).\n\nQ: Things that are equivalent according to the equivalence principle\
  \ are\n(A) space and time. (B) a traveling twin and a stay-at-home twin. (C) gravity\
  \ and acceleration. (D) mass and energy.\nA: Let's think step by step. Einstein’s\
  \ famous equivalence principle states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent.\
  \ The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of these three elements has the most mass per nucleon?\n\
  (A) Hydrogen (B) Iron (C) Uranium (D) Same in each\nA: Let's think step by step.\
  \ Due to nuclear binding energy, the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the\
  \ sum of individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons; this is\
  \ known as the mass defect. Hydrogen has no mass defect because it has only a single\
  \ nucleon, so it will have the most mass per nucleon. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A\
  \ model airplane flies slower when flying into the wind and faster with wind at\
  \ its back. When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed\
  \ compared with flying in still air is\n(A) the same (B) greater (C) less (D) either\
  \ greater or less depending on wind speed\nA: Let's think step by step. The plane’s\
  \ speed in the direction of the wind is greater than it would be in the absence\
  \ of wind, and its direction orthogonal to the wind is the same as it would be in\
  \ the absence of the wind. The total speed, which is these two components added\
  \ in quadrature, is thus greater than the speed in still air. The answer is (B).\n\n"
