  - question: 'Olivia used the rule "Add 11" to create the number pattern shown below.
      10, 21, 32, 43, 54. Which statement about the number pattern is true?

      (A) The 10th number in the pattern will be an even number.

      (B) The number pattern will never have two even numbers next to each other.

      (C) The next two numbers in the pattern will be an even number then an odd number.

      (D) If the number pattern started with an odd number then the pattern would
      have only odd numbers in it.'
    target: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect because every even-numbered
      term in the pattern is odd, and 10 is an even number. Choice B is correct, because
      adding an odd number (in this case 11) to an odd number produces an even number,
      and adding an odd number to an even number produces an odd number. Thus the
      terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, so there will never
      be two even numbers next to each other. Choice C is incorrect because the last
      term in the example is even (54), and we know that the terms will alternate
      between even and odd. Choice D is incorrect because the terms in the pattern
      will alternate between odd and even, regardless of the value of the first term.
      The answer is (B).
  - question: 'The population of the city where Michelle was born is 145,826. What is
      the value of the 5 in the number 145,826?

      (A) 5 thousands

      (B) 5 hundreds

      (C) 5 tens

      (D) 5 ones'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. Choice A is correct, because there are three
      digits following the 5, so

      the 5 is in the thousands place. Thus the other choices are incorrect. The answer
      is (A).'
  - question: "A store sells 107 different colors of paint. They have 25 cans of each\
      \ color in storage. The number of cans of paint the store has in storage can\
      \ be found using the expression below. 107 \xD7 25. How many cans of paint does\
      \ the store have in storage?\n(A) 749\n(B) 2,675\n(C) 2,945\n(D) 4,250"
    target: Let's think step by step. We can calculate 107 x 25 = (100 x 25) + (7
      x 25) = 2500 + 175 = 2675. The answer is (B).
  - question: 'A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly
      5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number
      of teams needed?

      (A) Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.

      (B) Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.

      (C) Multiply 30 and 5 to find 150 teams.

      (D) Subtract 5 from 30 to find 25 teams.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We want to find the number of teams. We know
      that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players. Thus to get the number of teams
      we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6 teams.
      The answer is (B).
  - question: 'Which expression is equivalent to 5 x 9?

      (A) (5 x 4) x (6 x 5)

      (B) (5 x 5) + (5 x 4)

      (C) (5 x 5) + (5 x 9)

      (D) (5 x 9) x (6 x 9)'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We know that 9 = (5 + 4), so 5 x 9 = 5 x (5
      + 4) = (5 x 5) + (5 x 4). The answer is (B).'
