  \ school us history.\n\nQ: This question refers to the following information.\n\
  I come not to urge personal claims, nor to seek individual benefits; I appear as\
  \ the advocate of those who cannot plead their own cause; I come as the friend of\
  \ those who are deserted, oppressed, and desolate. In the Providence of God, I am\
  \ the voice of the maniac whose piercing cries from the dreary dungeons of your\
  \ jails penetrate not your Halls of Legislation. I am the Hope of the poor crazed\
  \ beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your poor-houses.\
  \ I am the Revelation of hundreds of wailing, suffering creatures, hidden in your\
  \ private dwellings, and in pens and cabins—shut out, cut off from all healing influences,\
  \ from all mind-restoring cares.… Could their melancholy histories be spread before\
  \ you as revealed to my grieved spirit during the last three months, how promptly,\
  \ how earnestly would you search out the most approved means of relief; how trifling,\
  \ how insignificant, by comparison, would appear the sacrifices you are asked to\
  \ make; how would a few dimes and dollars, gathered from each citizen, diminish\
  \ in value as a possession, compared with the certain benefits and vast good to\
  \ be secured for the suffering insane...by the consecration and application of a\
  \ sufficient fund to the construction of a suitable hospital.…\n—Dorothea Dix, Memorial\
  \ Soliciting a State Hospital for the Protection and Cure of the Insane,\nSubmitted\
  \ to the General Assembly of North Carolina, November 1848\nDorothea Dix can best\
  \ be compared to whom?\n(A) Abigail Adams (B) Clara Barton (C) Shirley Temple (D)\
  \ Hillary Clinton\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on\
  \ us history for help. Both Dorothea Dix and Clara barton are American nurses. The\
  \ answer is (B).\n\nQ: This question refers to the following information.\n\"As\
  \ our late Conduct at the Conestoga Manor and Lancaster have occasioned much Speculation\
  \ & a great diversity of Sentiments in this and neighboring Governments; some vindicating\
  \ & others condemning it; some charitably alleviating the Crime, & others maliciously\
  \ painting it in the most odious & detestable Colours, we think it our duty to lay\
  \ before the Publick, the whole Matter as it appeared, & still appears, to us. .\
  \ . .\n\"If these things are not sufficient to prove an unjustifiable Attachment\
  \ in the Quakers to the Indians Savages, a fixed Resolution to befriend them & an\
  \ utter insensibility to human Distresses, let us consider a few more recent Facts.\
  \ When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the\
  \ Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our\
  \ Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood\
  \ that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this\
  \ we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where\
  \ we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers\
  \ from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions\
  \ on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but\
  \ these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in\
  \ Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection\
  \ of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations\
  \ of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n—\"Apology of the Paxton\
  \ Boys\" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an\
  \ explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.\nThe sentiments expressed in\
  \ the explanation above reflect which of the ongoing tensions during the colonial\
  \ period of American history?\n(A) Tensions between British policies and the aspirations\
  \ of North American colonists. (B) Tensions between American Indians allied with\
  \ the French and those allied with the British. (C) Tensions between freed African\
  \ Americans and white planters. (D) Tensions between backcountry settlers and elites\
  \ within colonial America.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles\
  \ on us history for help. After the French and Indian War, the Scotch-Irish settlers\
  \ attacked American Indians. After the attacks on the Conestoga, about 250 Paxton\
  \ Boys present their grievances to the Pennsylvania legislature. As mentioned in\
  \ the information, the Paxton Boys cited resentiment at local elites. The answer\
  \ is (D).\n\nQ: This question refers to the following information.\nOur leaders\
  \ talk about stopping aggression from the north, but this was a struggle among groups\
  \ of Vietnamese until we intervened. We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from\
  \ Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it.\
  \ As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by\
  \ napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they\
  \ are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces,\
  \ \"A plague on both your houses.\" … Stop the bombing, north and south, end search\
  \ and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations\
  \ on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow\
  \ of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort\
  \ by Hanoi.\n—Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\n\
  Which of the following opinions from the 1960s most directly reflects the perspective\
  \ of George McGovern's speech?\n(A) Americans must maximize their technological\
  \ edge in Vietnam. (B) American bombing in Vietnam is step by step leading to progress\
  \ in the war. (C) American bombing in Vietnam is a failure. (D) America must not\
  \ give in to defeatism about the war in Vietnam.\nA: Let's think step by step. We\
  \ refer to Wikipedia articles on us history for help. \"Stop the bombing\" and \"\
  Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the\
  \ south\" indicate that the perspective of George McGovern's speech is that Amerian\
  \ bombing in Vietnam is a failure. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: This question refers\
  \ to the following information.\n\"In the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will\
  \ be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more\
  \ generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited\
  \ power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they\
  \ could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined\
  \ to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which\
  \ we have no voice, or Representation.\"\nAbigail Adams, in a letter to John Adams,\
  \ 1776\n\"Special legislation for woman has placed us in a most anomalous position.\
  \ Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing\
  \ an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may\
  \ hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong\
  \ to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and\
  \ be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person,\
  \ property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband,\
  \ the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless\
  \ by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the\
  \ right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership\
  \ during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools\
  \ and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities\
  \ girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest\
  \ institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan\
  \ and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already granted in the several\
  \ States are by no means secure.\"\nSusan B. Anthony, \"Declaration of Rights for\
  \ Women,\" July 4, 1876\nThe sentiments expressed in the second excerpt by Susan\
  \ B. Anthony are most likely in support of\n(A) the Equal Rights Amendment (B) universal\
  \ suffrage (C) states' rights (D) prohibition\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer\
  \ to Wikipedia articles on us history for help. The above information mentioned\
  \ that women are in an anomalous position in terms of legislation. Women's earnings\
  \ do not belong to themselves, or they cannot testify against her husbands. Susan\
  \ believes women should have equal legal rights as men. The answer is (B).\n\nQ:\
  \ This question refers to the following information.\n\"Society in every state is\
  \ a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in\
  \ its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the\
  \ same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government,\
  \ our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we\
  \ suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of\
  \ kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses\
  \ of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other\
  \ lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a\
  \ part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this\
  \ he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him\
  \ out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design\
  \ and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears\
  \ most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is\
  \ preferable to all others.\"\nThomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776\nWhich of the following\
  \ \"miseries\" alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists of the post-Revolutionary\
  \ era?\n(A) Organized response to Bacon's Rebellion (B) Federal response to Shays's\
  \ Rebellion (C) Federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion (D) Federal response to\
  \ Pontiac's Rebellion\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles\
  \ on us history for help. Anti-Federalists do not believe centralized government\
  \ power, and suspect Washington's military response to Whiskey Rebellion. Bacon's\
  \ Rebellion and Pontiac's Rebellion happen before the Revolution and they can be\
  \ ruled out. The answer is (C).\n\n"
