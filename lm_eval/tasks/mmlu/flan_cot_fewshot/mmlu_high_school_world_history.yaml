"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high\
  \ school world history.\n\nQ: This question refers to the following information.\n\
  \"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase\
  \ its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would\
  \ have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and\
  \ industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only\
  \ be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets\
  \ of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western\
  \ Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by\
  \ geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press.\n\
  Alfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nThe \"quantum jump\" mentioned\
  \ in the passage most directly contributed to which of the following developments\
  \ in the period 1450–1750 C.E.?\n(A) A breakdown in trade routes through the collapse\
  \ of the established state structure (B) An increase in the population of the world\
  \ through more plentiful supplies of food (C) The spread of Chinese and Indian belief\
  \ systems across the world (D) An increase in social unrest\nA: Let's think step\
  \ by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on world history for help. The \"quantum\
  \ jump\" mentioned in the passage refers to the conquest of the New World and the\
  \ Columbian Exchange. Choice (A) and (C) did not happen in history. Choice (C) refers\
  \ to the human assets. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: This question refers to the following\
  \ information.\n\"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding\
  \ the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries.\
  \ It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being\
  \ used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced\
  \ by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether\
  \ they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore,\
  \ involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested\
  \ in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned\
  \ State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign\
  \ investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in\
  \ the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah,\
  \ Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following provides the best context for Nkrumah's\
  \ writings?\n(A) The Industrial Revolution (B) Decolonization (C) Regional Free\

  Indeed, as both the fatwas of distinguished [scholars] who base their opinion on\
  \ reason and tradition alike and the consensus of the Sunni community agree that\
  \ the ancient obligation of extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil innovation\
  \ must be the aim of our exalted aspiration, for \"Religious zeal is a victory for\
  \ the Faith of God the Beneficent\"; then, in accordance with the words of the Prophet\
  \ (Peace upon him!) \"Whosoever introduces evil innovation into our order must be\
  \ expelled\" and \"Whosoever does aught against our order must be expelled,\" action\
  \ has become necessary and exigent…\"\nLetter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I to Safavid\
  \ Shah Ismail I, 1514\nThe letter from Selim I is most clearly an example of which\
  \ of the following?\n(A) The maintenance of military supremacy at all costs (B)\
  \ Expanding tensions between religious sects (C) Factors that brought about the\

  \ to the following information.\n\"The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity\
  \ of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure\
  \ that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and\
  \ unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness,\
  \ he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does\
  \ not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help\
  \ for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and\
  \ diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired,\
  \ especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\

  \ refers to the following information.\nHe contains all works and desires and all\
  \ perfumes and all tastes. He enfolds the whole universe and in silence is loving\
