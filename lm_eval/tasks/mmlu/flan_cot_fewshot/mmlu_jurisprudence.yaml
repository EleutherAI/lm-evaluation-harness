"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about jurisprudence.\n\
  \nQ: Iverson Jewelers wrote a letter to Miller, 'We have received an exceptionally\
  \ fine self winding Rolox watch which we will sell to you at a very favorable price.'\n\
  (A) The letter is an offer to sell (B) A valid offer cannot be made by letter. (C)\
  \ The letter contains a valid offer which will terminate within a reasonable time.\
  \ (D) The letter lacks one of the essential elements of an offer.\nA: Let's think\
  \ step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for help. An offer\
  \ shows the intent to enter into a mutually-beneficial contract with specific terms.\
  \ An offer can be made by a letter. While this letter indicates the willingness\
  \ to sell, the lack of specific terms, such as transaction price and offer expiration\
  \ date, makes it an incomplete offer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Functions of the\
  \ law include all but which of the following?\n(A) maximizing individual freedom\
  \ (B) providing a basis for compromise (C) keeping the peace (D) promoting the principles\
  \ of the free enterprise system\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on jurisprudence for help. Laws are fundamentally about helping resolve\
  \ disputes between individuals, and therefore essential for maximizing individual\
  \ freedom, providing a basis for compromise, and keeping the peace. The answer is\
  \ (D).\n\nQ: The ________ School of jurisprudence postulates that the law is based\
  \ on what is \"correct.\"\n(A) Natural Law (B) Analytical (C) Historical (D) Sociological\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for\
  \ help. Natural Law School of jurisprudence focuses on the laws of nature, and states\
  \ that the law should be based on ethics, morals, and what is \"correct\". Analytical\
  \ deals with the law as it already exists, Historical postulates that the law was\
  \ found and not made, and Sociological studies how the law and society impact each\
  \ other. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which word best summarizes Weber's explanation\
  \ of the development of formally rational law?\n(A) Authority. (B) Charisma. (C)\
  \ Co-operation. (D) Capitalism.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on jurisprudence for help. Weber explained the development of formal\
  \ rationality in laws as how the modern society moved from tradition to rationality,\
  \ where people decide actions based less on how they were culturally done and more\
  \ on expected utilities. How rational individuals optimize efficiency of accomplishing\
  \ tasks for higher rewards is a core principle of Capitalism. The answer is (D).\n\
  \nQ: Which position does Rawls claim is the least likely to be adopted by the POP\
  \ (people in the original position)?\n(A) The POP would choose equality above liberty.\
  \ (B) The POP would opt for the 'maximin' strategy. (C) The POP would opt for the\
  \ 'difference principle'. (D) The POP would reject the 'system of natural liberty.'\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for\
  \ help. The POP would opt for the 'maximin' strategy, opt for the 'difference principle',\
  \ and reject the 'system of natural liberty', but the POP would not choose equality\
  \ above liberty, since the POP assume both equal and free citizens. The answer is\
  \ (A).\n\n"
