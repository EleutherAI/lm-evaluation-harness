  The letter contains a valid offer which will terminate within a reasonable time.
  (D) The letter lacks one of the essential elements of an offer.

  help. An offer shows the intent to enter into a mutually-beneficial contract with
  specific terms. An offer can be made by a letter. While this letter indicates the
