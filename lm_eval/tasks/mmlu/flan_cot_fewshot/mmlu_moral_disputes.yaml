"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about moral\
  \ disputes.\n\nQ: Baron admits that the versions of the ticking bomb hypothetical\
  \ she discusses are \"stunningly stupid,\" but she claims this is actually evidence\
  \ of\n(A) the stupidity of most traditional philosophical examples. (B) a general\
  \ lack of intelligence among people with advanced degrees. (C) the wrongness of\
  \ torture. (D) the readiness on the part of many intelligent people to see torture\
  \ as the best solution to deal with terrorism.\nA: Let's think step by step. We\
  \ refer to Wikipedia articles on moral disputes for help. The ticking bomb hypothetical\
  \ poses a problem where many people will die to an exploding bomb, if the hypothetical\
  \ terrorist does not disclose how to defuse it. Baron sees this hypothetical as\
  \ silly, but its prevalence does suggest intelligent people, particularly utilitarians,\
  \ see torture as justifiable to save the lives in this scenario. The answer is (D).\n\
  \nQ: A fertilized ovum is also known as\n(A) a zygote. (B) an embryo. (C) a viability.\
  \ (D) a blastocyst.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles\
  \ on moral disputes for help. Once a single sperm penetrates the layers of an egg\
  \ to form a new cell, that cell is called a zygote. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Pence\
  \ compares six different cases of reproduction, from natural twinning to SCNT. What\
  \ conclusion does he draw from this comparison?\n(A) SCNT is not a different kind\
  \ of reproduction because there are no morally relevant differences between it and\
  \ other permissible means of reproduction. (B) Because there is a low risk of harm\
  \ for natural twinning, there will be a low risk of harm for SCNT. (C) both A and\
  \ B (D) neither A nor B\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles\
  \ on moral disputes for help. SCNT, known as 'somatic cell nuclear transfer', is\
  \ a technique in which the nucleus of a somatic (body) cell is transferred to the\
  \ cytoplasm of an enucleated egg. This is used in farm animal cloning. Pence may\
  \ compare this to other processes of reproduction, and see little moral separation.\
  \ The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following is an intrinsic good, according\
  \ to Singer?\n(A) being in the upper class (B) the ability to learn and solve problems\
  \ (C) being more beautiful than most of the population (D) being shorter than average\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on moral disputes for\
  \ help. Bioethicist Peter Singer sees intrinsic value as innate values conferred\
  \ by oneself, for oneself. Innanimate objects can be beautiful, short, or have some\
  \ valuable criteria, but capabilities are intrinsically good. The answer is (B).\n\
  \nQ: According to Metz, what is wrong with consequentialist arguments against capital\
  \ punishment based on African values?\n(A) It is unclear as of yet whether or not\
  \ capital punishment deters harm to the community. (B) It is unclear as of yet whether\
  \ or not capital punishment deters harm to any individuals. (C) Consequentialism\
  \ is not supported by African values. (D) Even though consequentialism is supported\
  \ by African values, no consequentialist arguments framed in terms of African values\
  \ have been offered.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles\
  \ on moral disputes for help. Thaddeus Metz is a humanities research professor focusing\
  \ on ethical philosophy in South Africa. Metz has written the death penalty is unjustified\
  \ as it treats individuals as incapable of communal relations. It is unclear that\
  \ capital punishment is to the benefit of, or a deterrent of harm to the community.\
  \ The answer is (A).\n\n"
