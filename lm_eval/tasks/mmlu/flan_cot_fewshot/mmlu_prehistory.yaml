  \nQ: What is the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus?\n(A) under 650\
  \ cc (B) about 800 cc (C) just under 1000 cc (D) 1200 cc\nA: Let's think step by\
  \ step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help. The average cranium\
  \ capacity of Homo erectus is less than 1000 cubic cm. The answer is (C).\n\nQ:\
  \ According to Timothy Pauketat, the evidence for social stratification and political\
  \ power at Cahokia suggests:\n(A) a center of Mississippian civilization with conditions\
  \ similar to the rise of early states. (B) the limitations of authority in a Native\
  \ American society of egalitarian foragers. (C) a simple chiefdom or perhaps a complex\
  \ chiefdom had evolved by A.D. 1500. (D) a center of Mississippian civilization\
  \ with conditions similar to societies on the Northwest Coast of North America.\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help.\
  \ Timothy Pauketat is known for his research on Cahokia, the center of the Mississippian\
  \ culture, where he found similar conditions to the rise of early states. The answer\
  \ is (A).\n\nQ: Recent research on hominid species dating from the Middle Pliocene\
  \ indicates there was (as of 2020):\n(A) a great amount of species diversity, or\
  \ a single species that exhibited a lot of diversity. (B) very little species diversity\
  \ during this period and very few hominids. (C) decreased species diversity due\
  \ to a prolonged ice age followed by a severe drought. (D) decreased species diversity\
  \ but increased numbers of hammerstones and flakes, indicating stone tool manufacture.\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help.\
  \ Recent research has recognized multiple hominid species from the Middle Pliocene,\
  \ meaning that there is a great amount of species diversity or diversity in a single\
  \ species. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Researchers now believe that the decline of\
  \ the Maya was caused chiefly by:\n(A) a cataclysm of some kind, such as an earthquake,\
  \ volcano, or tsunami. (B) ecological degradation resulting from slash-and-burn\
  \ farming techniques. (C) endless wars between neighboring Mayan city-states. (D)\
  \ practices of interbreeding that led to a steep rise in congenital disorders.\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help.\
  \ Researchers believe that the Maya collapse was mainly caused by over-exploitation\
  \ of natural resources like the slash-and-burn farming techniques. The answer is\
  \ (B).\n\nQ: The great Mayan king Pacal built temples in the city of Palenque in\
