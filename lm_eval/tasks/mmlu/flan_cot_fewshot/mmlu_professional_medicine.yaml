"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional\
  \ medicine.\n\nQ: A 22-year-old male marathon runner presents to the office with\
  \ the complaint of right-sided rib pain when he runs long distances. Physical examination\
  \ reveals normal heart and lung findings and an exhalation dysfunction at ribs 4-5\
  \ on the right. Which of the following muscles or muscle groups will be most useful\
  \ in correcting this dysfunction utilizing a direct method?\n(A) anterior scalene\
  \ (B) latissimus dorsi (C) pectoralis minor (D) quadratus lumborum\nA: Let's think\
  \ step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Among the options,\
  \ only pectoralis minor muscle origins from the outer surfaces of the 3rd to 5th\
  \ ribs. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with\
  \ a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he\
  \ climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of\
  \ the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a\
  \ posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that\
  \ springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\n(A) left-on-left\
  \ sacral torsion (B) left-on-right sacral torsion (C) right unilateral sacral flexion\
  \ (D) right-on-right sacral torsion\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on medicine for help. The deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on\
  \ the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion.\
  \ All other options have a deep sulcus on the right. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A\
  \ 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat,\
  \ nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is\
  \ worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness\
  \ of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than\
  \ the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4°C (99.4°F), pulse 88/min,\
  \ respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares\
  \ shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema\
  \ and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable\
  \ cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is\
  \ the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\n(A) Allergic rhinitis (B) Epstein-Barr\
  \ virus (C) Mycoplasma pneumonia (D) Rhinovirus\nA: Let's think step by step. We\
  \ refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The symptoms, especially the\
  \ headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus\
  \ will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs\
  \ are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia. The answer is\
  \ (D).\n\nQ: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months\
  \ after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased\
  \ appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries\
  \ frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her\
  \ house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it.\
  \ She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals\
  \ are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\n\
  (A) Dopamine (B) Glutamate (C) Norepinephrine (D) Serotonin\nA: Let's think step\
  \ by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The patient feels\
  \ sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive\
  \ emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the\
  \ patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A\
  \ 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing\
  \ adrenalectomy scheduled in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency\
  \ department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision.\
  \ At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed\
  \ an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including\
  \ complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests,\
  \ were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had\
  \ never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications.\
  \ A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine\
  \ and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred\
  \ to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature\
  \ 36.6°C (97.9°F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95\
  \ mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative\
  \ preparation should include treatment with which of the following?\n(A) Labetalol\
  \ (B) A loading dose of potassium chloride (C) Nifedipine (D) Phenoxybenzamine\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help.\
  \ The symptoms and the adrenal mass suggested pheochromocytoma, and the blood pressure\
  \ indicates hypertension. Phenoxybenzamine is used to treat hypertension caused\
  \ by pheochromocytoma. The answer is (D).\n\n"
