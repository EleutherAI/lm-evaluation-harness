"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional\
  \ psychology.\n\nQ: In the construction of a multiple regression equation for purposes\
  \ of prediction, the optimal combination of measures is one in which the predictors\n\
  (A) are uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the criterion\
  \ (B) have low correlations with each other and low correlations with the criterion\
  \ (C) are highly intercorrelated with each other and moderately correlated with\
  \ the criterion (D) have low correlations with the criterion bur are moderately\
  \ correlated with each other\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on psychology for help. The basis of multiple regression is to assess\
  \ the relationship between one continuous variable and a set of independent variables.\
  \ So the predictors should be uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated\
  \ with the criterion. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: There are three ways to measure the\
  \ Central Tendency: the Mean, the Median and the Mode. From your knowledge about\
  \ them, what is the mode?\n(A) less sensitive to extreme scores than the mean (B)\
  \ more useful for skewed distributions (C) sensitive to extreme values and highly\
  \ skewed distributions (D) the most frequently occurring number\nA: Let's think\
  \ step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The definition\
  \ of mode is the most frequently occurring number. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Carl\
  \ Jung believed that a client's transference:\n(A) is a fantasy that distracts the\
  \ client from reality. (B) represents “mixed feelings” toward the therapist. (C)\
  \ \"is a form of \"\"acting out.\"\"\" (D) reflects the client’s personal and collective\
  \ unconscious.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology\
  \ for help. Transference is a phenomenon that a person's feelings are unconsciously\
  \ redirected, so it reflects the client's personal and collective unconscious. The\
  \ answer is (D).\n\nQ: In terms of Hofstede’s (1980) five cultural dimensions, the\
  \ United States scores at the top of the scale on:\n(A) individualism. (B) individualism\
  \ and power distance. (C) power distance and masculinity. (D) uncertainty avoidance.\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help.\
  \ US scores highest on individualism among the five cultural dimensions. The answer\
  \ is (A).\n\nQ: One of your therapy clients asks your advice about a good weight-\
  \ reduction program. You have investigated the programs in the community and are\
  \ enrolled in the one you consider the best. This program offers a $50 bonus to\
  \ its patrons for each new person they bring into the program. Under these circumstances,\
  \ your most appropriate response would be to\n(A) tell your client the pros and\
  \ cons of each program you know about except for the one in which you are enrolled\
  \ (B) recommend to your client the program in which you are enrolled and explain\
  \ the $50 bonus you will receive (C) recommend to your client the program in which\
  \ you are enrolled and offer to have the $50 bonus credited to your client's account\
  \ in the program (D) tell your client the pros and cons of each program you know\
  \ about, but do not claim the $50 bonus if your client enrolls in your program\n\
  A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help.\
  \ Based on the circumstances, you should tell your client about the pros and cons\
  \ of each program, but it would be inappropriate to receive the bonus, so you should\
  \ not claim the $50 bonus. The answer is (D).\n\n"
