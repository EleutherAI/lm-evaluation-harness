"description": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about virology.\n\
  \nQ: The median survival time to AIDS and death was established by following:\n\
  (A) Seroprevalent HIV-infected individuals (B) Seronegatives (C) Seroconverters\
  \ (D) High-risk seronegatives\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on virology for help. The median survival time to AIDS and death was\
  \ established as a result of the development of seroconverters. The answer is (C).\n\
  \nQ: Which of the following is a morphological characteristic of the paramyxoviruses.\n\
  (A) Fragile viruses often visualised with RNA spewing from the inside (B) Elongate\
  \ viruses (C) Icosahedral viruses with envelope (D) Very large viruses\nA: Let's\
  \ think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. Paramyxoviruses\
  \ are fragile viruses often visualised with RNA spewing from the inside. The answer\
  \ is (A).\n\nQ: The most important goal of a behavioral intervention is:\n(A) Change\
  \ in behavior (B) Comprehensive coverage (C) Effective use of behavioral theory\
  \ (D) Sustained behavior change\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on virology for help. The prim goal of a behavioral intervention is to\
  \ cause sustained behavior change. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A key factor facilitating\
  \ the application of nested case-control studies from the MACS was:\n(A) Data collection\
  \ (B) Establishment of a repository of biologic specimens (C) Participant interest\
  \ (D) Administration of the questionnaire by staff\nA: Let's think step by step.\
  \ We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort\
  \ Study's use of nested case-control studies was facilitated by the establishment\
  \ of a repository of biologic specimens. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Why are parvoviruses\
  \ a highly impactful parasite?\n(A) Because they have no nucleic acid (B) They require\
  \ a helper virus (C) Only replicate in dividing cells (D) Can integrate into host\
  \ chromosomes\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology\
  \ for help. Paroviruses are highly impactful because they do not have nucleic acid.\
  \ The answer is (A).\n\n"
