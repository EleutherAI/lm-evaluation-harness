{"abstract_algebra": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about abstract algebra.\n\nQ: Statement 1 | Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group. Statement 2 | The symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements.\n(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True\nA: Let's think step by step. A cyclic group is a group that is generated by a single element. Hence a subgroup generated by a single element of a group is cyclic and Statement 1 is True. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: The symmetric group $S_n$ has $\nactorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.\nFind the characteristic of the ring 2Z.\n(A) 0 (B) 3 (C) 12 (D) 30\nA: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Statement 1| Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. Statement 2 | Every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian.\n(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement 1 is true. Let $S$ be a finite set. If $f:S \nightarrow S$ is a onto function, then $|S| = |f(S)|$. If $f$ was not one to one, then for finite domain $S$ the image would have less than $S$ elements, a contradiction.\nStatement 2 is true. Let $G$ be an abelian group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. We need to show that $H$ is abelian. Let $a,b \\in H$. Then $a,b \\in G$ and $ab=ba$. Since $G$ is abelian, $ab=ba$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $ab \\in H$. Therefore, $ab=ba$ and $H$ is abelian. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Statement 1 | If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. Statement 2 | If H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G.\n(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement 2 is false. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $S_3$ generated by the cycle $(1,2)$ and $K$ be a subgroup of $S_3$ generated by the cycle $(1,3)$. Both $H$ and $K$ have two elements, the generators and the identity. However $HK$ contains cycles (1,2), (1,3) and (2,3,1), but the inverse of (2,3,1) is (2,1,3) and it does not belong to HK, hence HK is not a subgroup. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field.\n(A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field if and only if x^2 + c does not have roots in Z_3. That is x^2 + c != 0 for every x in Z_3. If c = 0, then x^2 + c = x^2 has root 0. If c = 1 then x^2 + c = x^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 for x = 0, 1 + 1 = 2 for x = 1 and 1 + 1 = 2 for x = 2, hence x^2 + 1 does not have any roots. For c = 2 the polynomial x^2 + 2 has two roots at x = 1 and x = 2. Hence Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field if and only if c = 1. The answer is (B).\n\n", "anatomy": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about anatomy.\n\nQ: Which of the following is the body cavity that contains the pituitary gland?\n(A) Abdominal (B) Cranial (C) Pleural (D) Spinal\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. The pituitary gland is the major endocrine gland attached to the base of the brain, and it is contained in the Cranial cavity. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of these branches of the trigeminal nerve contain somatic motor processes?\n(A) The supraorbital nerve (B) The infraorbital nerve (C) The mental nerve (D) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. \nWe know the following: (A) The supraorbital nerve (also known as the frontal nerve) is the largest branch of the ophthalmic nerve and branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. (B) The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. (C) The mental nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Because all these nerves are purely sensory nerves and do not contain any somatic motor processes. Therefore, the answer should be none of the above, which is (D). The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In Angle's Class II Div 2 occlusion there is\n(A) excess overbite of the upper lateral incisors. (B) negative overjet of the upper central incisors. (C) excess overjet of the upper lateral incisors. (D) excess overjet of the upper central incisors.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. This is a question related to anatomy and orthodontics. Excess overjet is associated with Class II occlusions; therefore, we can safely eliminate (B) from the list, as negative overjet is often associated with Class III occlusions. Now, we need to determine the location of the excess overjet, and that would be the upper (maxillary) lateral incisors. Only (C) has the correct information. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: The pleura\n(A) have no sensory innervation. (B) are separated by a 2 mm space. (C) extend into the neck. (D) are composed of respiratory epithelium.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. First, recall that the pleura refers to the thin layer of tissue that covers the lungs and lines the interior wall of the chest cavity. Now, let\u2019s look at each option:\nOption (A): \u201cThe pleura have no sensory innervation.\u201d This information is not correct. The pleura do have a sensory innervation.\nOption (B): \u201cThe pleura are separated by a 2 mm space.\u201d This information is not correct. There is a very thin \u201cpotential\u201d space between the layers of the pleura; however, it is typically filled with serous pleural fluid. \nOption (C): \u201cThe pleura extend into the neck.\u201d This information is actuakky true. The cervical pleura, also known as the dome of the pleuradome of the pleura, lines the extendsiton of the pleural cavity into the neck.\nOption (D): \u201cThe pleura are composed of respiratory epithelium.\u201d This information is not correct. The pleaura are composed of connective tissue (CT).\nBecause (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect, (D) is the only correct answer. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?\n(A) The first pharyngeal arch (B) The first and second pharyngeal arches (C) The second pharyngeal arch (D) The second and third pharyngeal arches\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. The hyoid bone, which is also known as the hyooid, is a a small U-shaped bone located in the anterior neck. In its resting position, it lies between the ase of the mandible and the third cervical vertebrae. We know that the second and the third pharyngeal arches give rise to the horns of the hyoid bone; therefore, the embryological origin of the hyoid bone are the second and the third pharyngeal arches\u2014this information is covered in the last option (D). Therefore, we conclude that (D) must be the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\n", "astronomy": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\n", "business_ethics": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about business ethics.\n\nQ: In contrast to _______, _______ aim to reward favourable behaviour by companies.

(B) They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart. (C) They are members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats and nutrition sources. (D) They lack paired, jointed appendages.\nA: Let's think step by step. Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages, which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?\n(A) 1/400 (B) 19/400 (C) 20/400 (D) 38/400\nA: Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. \u200bThe frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\\sqrt{\frac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400.

It is a gradient in water pressure that induces the movement of phloem content, which refers to answer (B). The mechanism of movement does not rely on metabolism, which rules out (A). Transpiration refers to the exhalation of water vapor through plant stomata, and is also not related, which rules out (C). While the apoplastic pathway is one of two main pathways for water transport in plants, it is not central to the pressure flow model, which rules out (D). The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following contain DNA sequences required for the segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis?\n(A) Telomeres (B) Centromeres (C) Nucleosomes (D) Spliceosomes\nA: Let's think step by step. The genetic material in Telomeres is not used, which rules out (A). Nucleosomes are the repeating subunit that comprises chromatin packed in a cell nucleus, and do not specifically refer to DNA sequences necessary for segregating chromosomes in cell division, which rules out (C). A spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein that removes introns from transcribed pre-mRNA rather than governing chromosome segregation. Centromeres are directly responsible for segregating chromosomes in cell division. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: The presence of homologous structures in two different organisms, such as the humerus in the front limb of a human and a bird, indicates that\n(A) the human and bird are polyphyletic species (B) a human's and bird's evolution is convergent (C) the human and bird belong to a clade (D) the human and bird developed by analogy\nA: Let's think step by step. Polyphyletic species are organisms that are grouped due to having similar characteristics but which do not have a common ancestor. This is not the case for humans and birds, which rules out (A). Convergent evolution refers to the indepdendent development of similar features in different species at different periods, which is also not the case for humans and birds, which rules out (B). Analogy refers to the superficial resemblance of structures that have different origins, which is not the case for the human and bird forearms, which rules out (D). Humans and birds do belong to the same clade - a group of organisms composed of a common ancestor. The answer is (C).\n\n", "college_chemistry": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college chemistry.\n\nQ: 3 Cl\u2212(aq) + 4 CrO_4^2\u2212(aq) + 23 H+(aq) \u2192 3 HClO2(aq) + 4 Cr3+(aq) + 10 H2O(l). In the reaction shown above, Cl\u2212(aq) behaves as\n(A) an acid (B) a base (C) a catalyst (D) a reducing agent\nA: Let's think step by step. A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C). Instead, the $Cl^{-} molecules carry a negative charge, which they donate in the reaction to form 3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing agent, or (D).

The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\nIII. The Singleton class has a private constructor.\n(A) I only\n(B) II only\n(C) III only\n(D) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.\nGiven these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct.

If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.\nNext, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.\nNext, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles.

Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\n(A) 1/50 (B) 1/27 (C) 1/25 (D) 2/27\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.\nThus a given processor has:\n(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =\n(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:\nmisses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.\nNext, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:\n50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:\ninstructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.\nNow, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:\nlock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.\nThus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:\nlock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =\n(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27.

We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative.

A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\n(A) 2 (B) 2 - e^-2 (C) 2 + e^-2 (D) 2 + e^-4\nA: Let's think step by step. For all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.\nWe use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\\prime}$ and $s^{\\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \\Rightarrow\\left[s^{\\prime}(t)=0\right]$. For all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n$$\n\frac{d}{d t}[\\ln (s-2)]=\frac{s^{\\prime}}{s-2}=\frac{-1}{25}=\frac{d}{d t}\\left[-\frac{t}{25}\right] .\n$$\nChoose $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$.

What is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?\n(A) 1 lag (B) 2 lags (C) 3 lags (D) 4 lags\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. First of all, let\u2019s recall that for a given set of data, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) allows us to measure how well a statistical model fits the data; it is an estimator of prediction error. Here in this problem we will need to use the formula ln(det(sigma_hat)) + (2 * k / T) to determine the values of Akaike\u2019s criterion, where ln denotes the natural log function, det the determinant function, k the total number of parameters in total (across both equations), and T the number of observations (which, in this case, is equal to 500). For 1 lag, the number of parameters in total is equal to 6; for 2 lags, it is 10; for 3 lags, it is 14; and for 4 lags, it is 18. Now, let\u2019s calculate the values of the criterion for each lag:\n(A) 1 lag: ln(0.0336) + (2 * 6 / 500) = ln(0.0336) + (12 / 500) = -3.369\n(B) 2 lags: ln(0.0169) + (2 * 10 / 500) = ln(0.0169) + (20 / 500) = -4.040\n(C) 3 lags: ln(0.0084) + (2 * 14 / 500) = ln(0.0084) + (28 / 500) =-4.724\n(D) 4 lags: ln(0.0062) + (2 * 18 / 500) = ln(0.0062) + (36 / 500) =-5.011\nBecause the optimal model order according to AIC minimizes the information criterion, the answer should be the one with the lowest value.

If heteroscedasticity is present in a regression model, then the coefficient estimates in the OLS estimator will be not only unbiased and consistent but also inefficient.

Thus the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, so there will never be two even numbers next to each other. Choice C is incorrect because the last term in the example is even (54), and we know that the terms will alternate between even and odd. Choice D is incorrect because the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, regardless of the value of the first term. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: The population of the city where Michelle was born is 145,826.

Protein synthesis starts at the ribosome, so we can eliminate (A) and (C). The ribosome is often in the endoplasmic reticulum and moves from there to the Golgi apparatus, where it is modified and packaged into a vesicle. The vesicle then floats to the plasma membrane and is secreted. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity?\n(A) By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum (B) By changing the enzyme\u2019s location in the cell (C) By changing the shape of the protein (D) An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity.\nA: Let's think step by step. A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\n(A) Translation (B) Conjugation (C) Specialized transduction (D) Transformation\nA: Let's think step by step. The introduction of foreign DNA or RNA into bacteria or eukaryotic cells is a common technique in molecular biology and scientific research. There are multiple ways foreign DNA can be introduced into cells including transformation, transduction, conjugation, and transfection. In contrast, (A) is not a way to form DNA: during translation the ribosomes synthesize proteins from RNA. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT\n(A) the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat (B) the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man (C) the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal (D) the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog\nA: Let's think step by step. \u200b\u200bHomologous structures are similar physical features in organisms that share a common ancestor \u200b\u200bbut different functions. Comparisons (B) and (C) are clearly homologous because they share a common ancestor and the structures serve different purposes. Bat wings and birg wings are also homologous, while they are both wings, the forelimbs serve different purposes. Insects and dogs are very far ancestors since one is vertebrate while the other is invertebrate and the forelimbs serve the same purpose, so they are not homologous. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not known to be involved in the control of cell division?\n(A) Cyclins (B) Protein kinases (C) Checkpoints (D) Fibroblast cells\nA: Let's think step by step. Normal cells move through the cell cycle in a regulated way. At the checkpoint stage, they use information about their own internal state and cues from the environment around them to decide whether to proceed with cell division. Cues like these act by changing the activity of core cell cycle regulators inside the cell. The most common regulators are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Fibroblast cells do not play any role in cell division.

An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is expected to be a polar molecule?\n(A) PCl4F (B) BF3 (C) CO2 (D) Si(CH3)4\nA: Let's think step by step. A polar molecule is one that has a slightly positive charge on one end of the molecule and a slightly negative charge on the other end. Boron trifluoride (BF3) has Boron as the center atom and three fluorine atoms attached to it; it is trigonal planar and symmetric, so it is nonpolar. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has Carbon as the central atom with double bonds to two Oxygen atoms - this is also symmetrical and therefore nonpolar. The same is the case for tetramethyl silane (SI(CH3)4), which is a Silicon atom surrounded by four methyl groups. The structure of PCL4F is that Phosphorus is the central atom, attached to four chlorines and one fluorine atom. This is asymmetrical, and therefore has a net dipole and is expected to be a polar molecule. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: From the solubility rules, which of the following is true?\n(A) All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble (B) All sulfates are soluble (C) All hydroxides are soluble (D) All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble\nA: Let's think step by step. The chlorides, bromides, and iodides of lead, silver, and mercury are not soluble in water. This rules out (A). The sulfates of lead, barium, and calcium are not soluble in water, which rules out (B). The hydroxides of any metal besides sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, and barium are insoluble. This rules out (C). Typically ammonium ions indicate a soluble ionic substance. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?\n(A) 3.89 (B) 7.78 (C) 5.78 (D) 2.33\nA: Let's think step by step. Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $\nrac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \nrac{10^{-3.89} \\cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?\n(A) 0.500 mole (B) 1.00 mole (C) 2.00 mole (D) 3.00 mole\nA: Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O \nightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles. The answer is (C).\n\n", "high_school_computer_science": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school computer science.\n\nQ: Which of the following is an example of the use of a device on the Internet of Things (IoT) ?\n(A) A car alerts a driver that it is about to hit an object. (B) A hiker uses a G P S watch to keep track of her position. (C) A refrigerator orders milk from an online delivery service when the milk in the refrigerator is almost gone. (D) A runner uses a watch with optical sensors to monitor his heart rate.\nA: Let's think step by step. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to common devices which are connected to the internet, enabling new functionality. Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe an internet connected device. In choice B, the watch is only described as having GPS functionality but no internet connectivity. Choice C describes a common device (a refrigerator) which has internet connectivity enabling new functionality (online ordering). Choice D does not mention internet connectivity for the watch, only optical sensors. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Many Web browsers allow users to open anonymous windows. During a browsing session in an anonymous window, the browser does not record a browsing history or a list of downloaded files. When the anonymous window is exited, cookies created during the session are deleted. Which of the following statements about browsing sessions in an anonymous window is true?\n(A) The activities of a user browsing in an anonymous window will not be visible to people who monitor the user's network, such as the system administrator. (B) Items placed in a Web store's shopping cart for future purchase during the anonymous browsing session will not be saved on the user's computer. (C) A user will not be able to log in to e-mail or social media accounts during the anonymous browsing session. (D) A user browsing in an anonymous window will be protected from viruses launched from any web sites visited or files downloaded.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect as it only describes network traffic, which an anonymous browser does not change. Choice B is correct as it correctly describes how an anonymous browser will prevent saving data on the user\u2019s computer after the session is ended. Choice C is incorrect because an anonymous browser will not prevent logging in to email or social media accounts. Choice D is incorrect because an anonymous browser in itself performs no virus protection.

Because X has the value 5, the first conditional IF (X < 0) is false, so we move to the first ELSE clause. Because X is 5 and Y is 10, the second conditional IF (X > Y) is false, so we move to the following ELSE clause. Since Y is 10, the conditional IF (Y > 0) is true, so the command DISPLAY (\"November\") is executed. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What is the output of \"abc\"[::-1] in Python 3?\n(A) Error (B) abc (C) cba (D) c\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the slicing operator [::-1] takes all of the elements in the string in reverse order, so we reverse the order of the string \"abc\", resulting in \"cba\". The answer is (C).\n\nQ: A list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n. The following algorithm is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The algorithm uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing.\n Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1.\n Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater than 100, increase the value of count by 1.\n Step 3: (missing step)\n Step 4: (missing step)\n Step 5: Display the value of count.\nWhich of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the algorithm works as intended?\n(A) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n(B) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of position is greater than n.\n(C) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n  Step 4: Increase the value of position by 1.\n(D) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of position is greater than n.\n  Step 4: Increase the value of count by 1.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect, because its Step 4 has an incorrect termination condition, stopping when count is greater than 100. We need to stop after inspecting all elements in the list. Choice B is correct because it correctly increments both count and position, and correctly repeats these steps and terminates when all elements in the list have been inspected. Choice C is incorrect because it incorrectly increments the variable count until its value is greater than 100, regardless of the elements in the list. Choice D is incorrect because its step 3 does not increment the value of position, so it will repeat forever.

All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\n(A) Capitalist (B) Scientific (C) Communist (D) Existentialist\nA: Let's think step by step.

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\n(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams (B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams (C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams (D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nA: Let's think step by step. Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams.

The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\n(A) If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1. (B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. (C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. (D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables.

When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n\u2014\"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.\nThe sentiments expressed in the explanation above reflect which of the ongoing tensions during the colonial period of American history?\n(A) Tensions between British policies and the aspirations of North American colonists.

Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.\"\nThomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776\nWhich of the following \"miseries\" alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists of the post-Revolutionary era?\n(A) Organized response to Bacon's Rebellion (B) Federal response to Shays's Rebellion (C) Federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion (D) Federal response to Pontiac's Rebellion\nA: Let's think step by step.

Data augmentation is used to increase the diversity of images in the training dataset. It is important that natural images are kept natural after being augmented. Vertical flips of images are not natural, so (B) is false. Posterization makes the image look like a poster and and dithering increases color depth. None of these two preserve the natural property. The only natural data augmentation technique is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\n(A) It is too computationally expensive. (B) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset. (C) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset. (D) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.\nA: Let's think step by step. Because the input is real valued, it is unlikely that the same values appear both at training and test time. This means that while such a decision tree could yield good performance on the training data, when evaluated on the test data it will perform badly because the decision tree won\u2019t know what to do with numbers that did not appear in the training data.

The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes.

The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.\nA: Let's think step by step.

(B) By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D) Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.\nA: Let's think step by step.

A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. (B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict.
