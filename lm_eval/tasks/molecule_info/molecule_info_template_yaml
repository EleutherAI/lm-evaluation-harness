description: "Answer the following questions. You will be provided with the SMILES expression of a molecule. Answer the exact mass of molecules. Think step by step. However, your last sentence should be \"The answer is [answer].\", where [answer] contains only numbers, without unit. \n"
doc_to_text: "Question: What is the exact mass of O?\nAnswer: The SMILES describes a H2O (water) molecule. One water molecule contains 2 hydrogen atoms with mass 1.008, and one oxygen atom which has mass 15.999. Therefore, the exact mass of an H2O molecule is 18.01. The answer is 18.01.\nQuestion: What is the exact mass of {{smiles}}?\nAnswer:"
