  - claim: "Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget."
    evidence: "The presidential candidates argued about the economy and fiscal policy at a debate on Oct. 7, 2008, in Nashville. Barack Obama criticized John McCain's talk of earmarks, saying that cutting earmarks would not significantly affect the federal deficit. Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget, Obama said. Fiscal conservatives concerned about the national debt  which is now more than $9-trillion in total often mention earmarks as something that needs fixing. But earmarks are only a small part of the problem. According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $18-billion for the 2008 budget, or roughly 10 percent of the deficit for that year. Another report found that appropriations bills in fiscal year 2008 included $16.5 billion for earmarks. Those numbers are lower than previous years because earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that years deficit of $318-billion. The numbers show Obama gets his earmark number correct."

  - claim: "Alabamas Crimson Tide will be the underdog in Saturdays game against the Georgia Bulldogs, the first time in 72 consecutive games that Alabama has not been favored by oddsmakers to win."
    evidence: "ESPN and other news outlets are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide likely will have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. Alabama hasnt walked on the field as the underdog in 72 consecutive games -- not since the SEC Championship against Florida in 2009, ESPN reported. Even then, as five-point underdogs, the Crimson Tide rolled over the Gators, 32-13. The team went on to win the national championship and has been favored by the oddsmakers to win every game since then --- until now. It is the longest such streak in modern college history, according to ESPN college football insider Phil Steele. Thats quite a claim -- one that caused PolitiFact Georgia to decide to temporarily step out of its comfort zone, truth-squading politicians and newsmakers, and check. So when Nick Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide roll into Sanford Stadium in Athens on Saturday, will they really be the underdog pick for the first time in 72 games? Or is that just more hype about the Bama-Bulldog rivalry? These two teams first met back in 1895 and have battled it out 66 times over the years, with Alabama coming out on top 37 times. Saturdays game marks the first time the Crimson Tide has visited Athens since 2008, when Georgia trailed 31-0 at halftime before losing 41-30. Underdog status isnt a subject to be broached with university officials in Alabama, Georgia, or any state for that matter. Thats because its based on whether a team is or isnt a betting favorite with Vegas oddsmakers, and betting in any form is against NCAA regulations. On Thursday, UGA was a 2.5-point at William Hills Nevada sportsbook. David Purdum, who covers the gambling industry as a staff writer for ESPN Chalk, told PolitiFact how he did his calculations. Using one of several online college football preview magazines, Purdum looked at Alabamas record against the spread since 2010 (36-34-1). The Tides streak as predicted game winner started with the national championship game against Texas in 2009, so adding that to the 71 games since 2010 is how Purdum, who also freelances as a high school sports reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, came up with the count of a record 72 games in a row. He also cross-checked the info with ESPNs Stats & Information Department, he said. For this Saturdays sellout game Between the Hedges in Athens, OddsShark.com had No. 8 ranked Georgia (4-0, 2-0 SEC) favored by a 2.5-point spread. And underdog status could still turn by kickoff on Saturday, depending on how the final betting goes. A win Saturday against No. 13 rated Alabama (3-1, 0-1 SEC) would be a huge boost for the Bulldogs. A loss could mean another second-tier bowl season for University of Coach Mark Richts program. But atAt a press conference Tuesday, Georgia Head Coach Mark Richt wasnt talking like Alabama is the games underdog. They're as good or better than they've ever been, in my opinion, he said of Alabama. The Crimson Tide rarely finds itself in a must-win situation this early in the season. But a second straight conference loss would be devastating for the team's playoff chances, while a win would put Alabama right back on track with home dates in three of the team's next four games. Our ruling ESPN and others are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide will likely have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. Thats based on the fact that for 72 games in a row Alabama was favored in betting to win. And that wasnt the case this week as bets started being placed for the game Saturday at Sanford Stadium. But since betting goes on down to the wire, theres at least a possibility that the underdog status could change up to game time. Thats why they call it gambling. And given the unknown, we have to hedge a bit ourselves at this stage of the game."

  - claim: "If you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent"
    evidence: "The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamas signature health care law, may have been signed in 2010, but it continues to shape the 2016 Republican presidential campaign. Carly Fiorina -- fresh off what many commentators considered a strong debate performance on Aug. 6 -- discussed her opposition to the health care law in an interview with host Jake Tapper on CNNs State of the Union. Tapper noted that Fiorina is a breast cancer survivor, and we're all very grateful for that. Didn't your experience show you that the pre-existing condition part of Obamacare is crucial, that there are so many people out there like you, but without your means, who wouldn't be alive if it were not for the part of the law that says, insurance companies have to take on people with pre-existing conditions? Fiorina responded, I absolutely endorse that goal. I did at the time. But guess what? None of that has worked. Demonstrably, if you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent. A reader asked us to check whether this is correct, so we took a look. The Fiorina camp didnt respond to inquiries. A look at a recent survey Reducing the influx of patients in emergency rooms was always a significant goal of the Affordable Care Act. Because hospitals by law cannot refuse emergency care, uninsured patients may be left with no option beyond the E.R. even to treat minor health issues. Yet this is an expensive solution for the health care system, since E.R. care costs much more than routine medical care dispensed by general practitioners. By increasing insurance coverage, the thinking went, patients would be steered toward providers who charge less than emergency rooms, saving money for insurers and, ultimately, for patients and taxpayers. So has it worked? The official statistics on emergency-room visits are published on an annual basis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the most recent report -- released in 2014 -- covers 2011, which was well before most elements of the health care law kicked in. So that data set is not helpful in judging the accuracy of Fiorinas claim. Failing that, the best data we have comes from a survey conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians in March 2015. The most relevant question in that survey was, Since January 1, 2014, when the requirement to have health coverage took effect in the Affordable Care Act, the volume of emergency patients in my emergency department has  increased greatly? increased slightly? remained the same? decreased slightly? decreased greatly? Heres the breakdown, based on the responses of 2,098 member physicians of the American College of Emergency Physicians  Response Percent of surveyed giving this response Increased greatly 28 percent Increased slightly 47 percent Remained the same 17 percent Decreased slightly 5 percent Decreased greatly 0 percent Not sure 3 percent  The finding that only 5 percent of respondents saw any decrease in patients in their emergency room provides some validation for Fiorinas claim. If this is a valid finding, then the health care law isnt only failing at one of its main missions, but its actually making things quite a bit worse. But Fiorina seems to have garbled her talking point. Fiorina said emergency room visits are up over 50 percent -- not that a majority of emergency room doctors say they are seeing more patients come for treatment. In reality, the survey does not offer specifics on how many more visits there have been after implementation of the law. And a plurality of respondents suggest that the increases theyve seen are slight, which doesnt sound like a word most people would use to describe a 50-percent increase. Another concern The American College of Emergency Physicians, as the sponsor of a survey, is not a neutral party in the same way a media pollster is. Also, the survey is what is known as an opt-in survey. Unlike a poll in which the survey company reaches out to a random selection of the desired population, the emergency physicians poll is one in which individual respondents have chosen whether or not to participate. Still, the point Fiorina raises is a concern among health-care policy specialists. The magazine Health Affairs noted in July that between 1992 and 2012 the number of patient visits to hospital emergency rooms has risen 47 percent -- from 91 million to 133 million -- even as the number of facilities serving them fell by 11 percent, from 5,035 to 4,460. Given this, 39 percent of E.R.s report daily overcrowding. Again, though, this data is from before the law fully went into effect. Such figures suggest a problem many years in the making, but theres also concern that the Affordable Care Act specifically has made the problem worse. One theory is that insurance rates have increased faster than the number of doctors available to serve the newly insured patients. This may have led some newly insured patients to fall back on old habits and make the E.R. their first option even for non-emergency care. Our ruling Fiorina said, If you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent. Fiorina has raised a legitimate concern about the health care law, but the eye-popping statistic she cites is not supported either by official federal data or by a recent survey of members of the American College of Emergency Physicians."

  - claim: "Says Sandra Bullock said to Hillary Clinton, If you dont like our president you can leave and never come back again."
    evidence: "A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isnt happy with how things are going. Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton, if you dont like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon, said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social networks efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October. While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didnt include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name. The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her new film, Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news, that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate. At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans. I dont agree with that at all, Bullock said. That was not a statement that I can get behind. I dont agree with that statement. The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullockhas adopted twoAfrican-American children -- a boy and a girl. I would like my rights represented and those of my son  very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them, she says. When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good. We found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton if you dont like our president you can leave and never come back again."

  - claim: "For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97% of the ice sheet thawed."
    evidence: "Everybody's looking for evidence that pollution, particularly the carbon dioxide released into the air, is (or is not, depending on your point of view) altering Earth's climate. On July 24, U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, whose state stands to face some serious consequences if warmer temperatures cause sea levels to rise and storms to become stronger, was on the floor of the Senate speaking about an event in July 2012 that produced a dramatic change in the massive ice sheet covering Greenland. Because of global warming, glaciers continue to retreat. The Greenland ice sheet provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice, Schatz said. For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed. Ninety-seven percent? One way to read that is that only 3 percent of Greenland's ice sheet remained. That would be A LOT of melting, especially for a mass of ice that is, over large stretches, a mile or two thick. Losing that much arctic ice would have a HUGE impact. Not only would sea level rise by roughly 20 feet, the ice would no longer be reflecting sunlight back into space, warming the planet even faster. We contacted Schatz's office, which directed us to two sources. The first was a web page from the National Snow & Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which tracks melting on a daily basis. It says, Greenlands surface melting in 2012 was intense, far in excess of any earlier year in the satellite record since 1979. In July 2012, a very unusual weather event occurred. For a few days, 97% of the entire ice sheet indicated surface melting. The estimate comes from satellite measurements. We also found a NASA web page that reported that in July 2012, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet surface had thawed by July 12. So the key word in each case is surface. The melting the satellites tracked was at and near the surface, often to a depth of no more than an inch. The ice sheet itself never thawed, or came close to thawing. Dorothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, whose examination of the event is to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, said unusually warm temperatures that month did produce some unusual melting, but it didn't wipe out most of the ice sheet. Sen. Schatz's statement is very misleading, she said in an email, noting that her estimate of surface melt is even higher. The correct statement would be that approximately 99% of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melt during a two-day period in July of 2012. In fact most of the ice sheet surface re-froze within hours or days of the big melt event. Hall said that the last time that much surface ice temporarily melted was about a century ago. If that begins to happen more frequently, that is a red flag, she said. At the highest elevations, the surface will only melt a few centimeters for a few minutes or hours, so none of that liquid water can run off and contribute to sea level rise, she said in an interview. The thaw was deeper and more extensive at lower altitudes, producing some ponds and runoff, but even in those cases, much of the water re-froze, although quite a bit made its way to the ocean to contribute to sea level rise. How much of the ice sheet was actually lost? Satellite data show that Greenland lost about 325 billion metric tons of ice that month, enough to raise sea level by nearly a millimeter. That's a lot. Typically, 340 billion metric tons are lost in a full year, according to climate researcher Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. However, the amount of ice lost was only about 0.01 percent of the nearly 3 million billion tons of ice locked in the sheet. When we asked Schatz's office if the senator misspoke, spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa stood by his comment. The senator said that 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed . . . which means to become soft, and does not mean vanish. He also specifically said 'for several days in July of 2012,' so that it would be clear that he was not implying that the ice vanished forever. To suggest that the senator said it disappeared is inaccurate. Thomas Mote, a geographer at the University of Georgia, says it's a common mistake to confuse the thawing of the surface ice with the thawing of the ice sheet. Certainly we did not lose 97 percent of the ice. Sea levels would quickly go up 20 feet, he said. We would notice that pretty quickly. Our ruling Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said, For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed. His first sentence is correct. Because he also prefaced his comment by asserting that glaciers continue to retreat and the ice sheet provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice, his contention that 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed, could easily be misinterpreted as referring to the whole ice sheet.

  - claim: "While Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work."
    evidence: "Although he didnt formally announce his candidacy until early this year, within months of taking office as Ohio treasurer in 2011, it was apparent that Republican Josh Mandel was running for the U.S. Senate.An ad from the campaign of his opponent, incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, targets his performance in Columbus, making this claim:While Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work.That made him sound like a no-show employee, which drew the interest of PolitiFact Ohio.We asked the Brown campaign to back up the claim. It cited an Associated Press story from Jan. 26, 2012, that reported Mandel was in Washington that day to attend a $500-a-plate breakfast fundraiser for his U.S. Senate campaign, continuing his trend of skipping meetings of a board he chairs that handles billions of Ohio's deposits.That is the State Board of Deposit, which decides which banks get custody of the state's money. Chaired by the treasurer, the panel also includes the auditor and attorney general. It meets monthly.The board's minutes show Mandel missed 14 consecutive meetings after taking office before attending his first one on March 19. He was quoted at the time as saying that it was the first meeting in two years involving a major decision about state deposits.Mandel's office noted he is permitted by statute to send a representative in his place when he misses the meetings. Board records show that he sent his chief financial officer and general counsel, Seth Metcalf.Both Auditor Dave Yost and Attorney General Mike DeWine also have sent surrogates, the records show. Like Mandel, the meeting March 19 was the first either of them attended personally.Though sending a designee to meetings is not uncommon, the Associated Press found Mandel unique among modern-era treasurers by attending none in his first year.An AP report from Jan. 25, 2012, said that Democrat Kevin Boyce and Republican Jennette Bradley both attended the boards monthly meetings less than half the time. Democrat Richard Cordray almost always went. Earlier treasurers Ken Blackwell, Joe Deters and Mary Ellen Withrow all attended at least occasionally.The online magazine Salon published a story on Oct. 3, 2012 -- after the Brown ad was broadcast -- noting that the state treasurer also serves on an additional seven boards or commissions. Mandel sent representatives but did not attend any of their meetings until last March, Salon said, citing information it was provided by the liberal research group American Bridge through open records requests.Mandel's spokesman Seth Unger, who called the report a red herring, said the treasurer has appointed designees to represent him on these boards, commissions and authorities, as has been customary under prior administrations both Democrat and Republican alike.Our designees have also confirmed that the other statewide officers currently on these boards send designees to represent their offices, he said. It should be noted that while these bodies remain in statute, some meet only very sporadically, and one has not convened for years.The Brown campaign also provided a list of 225 out-of-office events which could be viewed as political, from late March 2011 to early July 2012 -- 44 of them out-of-state, with all but three of those on workdays, and including at least 64 fundraisers.Democrats have pointed to Mandel's calendar before, as an article in The Plain Dealer reported last January, to argue he was barely working or that he was not being forthcoming in how he spends his time.While the events show Mandel's political involvement, however, they do not provide evidence that he failed to perform his duties of office, as spelled out in Chapter 113 of the Ohio Revised Code.The treasurer of state is an elected administrator. He does not have specified hours or attendance requirements. Its not like his office shuts down when he is not there. The treasurer has a staff that handles the daily operations of the office.When the Ohio Democratic Party made a public records request for Mandel's official schedule, the treasurer's officer delivered with it a copy of Mandel's 2011 Top-Bottom Review, listing what he considered his office's top accomplishments.The treasurer's Annual Report for fiscal 2012 listed more of what his office called steps to cut waste, reduce spending and increase efficiency. The week of Sept. 28, 2012, the office touted the launch of a searchable online database of Ohio's state-owned properties and buildings.What does all this say about the claim in Brown's TV ad, that while Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work?The claim in the Brown ad is partially accurate. His campaign cited meetings of the Board of Deposit, on which Mandel sits, including at least one case where Mandel was fundraising in Washington on the day of a meeting. It also cited at least 44 out-of-state political events from March 2011 to July 2012 from Mandels schedule -- slightly less than three per month -- and more than 200 out-of-office events, of which at least 64 were fundraisers.But the ad leaves out important details needed to put the claim in context.Members of the Board of Deposit are permitted to send a representative in their place. Mandel has done that, as did both the auditor and attorney general, who also are on the board.In assessing a claim about the state investment pools credit rating, PolitiFact Ohio talked to a financial expert from Standard & Poors who noted that Mandel deserved credit for his performance as state treasurer, an administrative post whose responsibilities by law are to safeguard and invest the states money. During the time he has been state treasurer, the states credit rating for its STAR Ohio investment fund has remained at the top level.It is not uncommon for politicians to run for higher office while holding an elected seat, and the that can have an impact on the amount of time they are in their current jobs.But the implication of the claim in the Brown campaign ad is that Mandel has neglected his duties as state treasurer while he campaigns for Senate. While there is support for the claim that he has been out of the office, we dont see evidence that the office is not functioning properly."
