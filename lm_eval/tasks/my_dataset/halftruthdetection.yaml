doc_to_text: |
  <s>[INST] You are an helpful AI assistant and you are tasked with evaluating the truthfulness of claims based on provided evidence. Each claim can be categorized into one of 5 labels: "true", "mostly-true", "half-true", "mostly-false", "false". Assess the claim given the evidence and classify it appropriately without providing an explanation. [/INST] I am excited to work on this classification problem. Can you please provide me the label description for all 5 labels.</s> [INST]
  [Label Descriptions]
  "true": The claim is entirely accurate and includes all relevant information. There are no omissions or distortions that could mislead the audience.
  "mostly-true": The claim is accurate, but it might benefit from additional context to provide a complete picture. However, the absence of this context does not alter the claim's accuracy.
  "half-true": The claim is true in a limited context. However, it omits crucial information that could significantly alter its interpretation, leading to potential misunderstanding or misinterpretation.
  "mostly-false": The claim contains some elements of truth but distorts or misrepresents critical facts. Important information is omitted, which could lead to a misleading impression despite some truthful elements.
  "false": The claim is entirely inaccurate and contradicts established facts. There is no truth to the claim, and it is likely to mislead those who encounter it.
  "pants-fire": The claim is completely false, fabricated, and lacks any basis in evidence or reality. It is deliberately misleading and designed to deceive.
  [/INST] Now, can you please provide me claim and evidence so that i can classify claim into one of the 5 labels: "true", "mostly-true", "half-true", "mostly-false", "false" based on the given evidence. </s>
