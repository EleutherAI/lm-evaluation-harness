            "evidence": "\nThe presidential candidates argued about the economy and fiscal policy at a debate on Oct. 7, 2008, in Nashville.\n \nBarack Obama criticized John McCain's talk of earmarks, saying that cutting earmarks would not significantly affect the federal deficit.\n \n\"Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget,\" Obama said.\n \nFiscal conservatives concerned about the national debt \u2014 which is now more than $9-trillion in total\u00a0\u2014 often mention earmarks as something that needs fixing. But earmarks are only a small part of the problem.\n \nAccording to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $18-billion for the 2008 budget, or roughly 10 percent of the deficit for that year. Another report found that appropriations bills in fiscal year 2008 included $16.5 billion for earmarks. Those numbers are lower than previous years because earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year\u2019s deficit of $318-billion.\n \nThe numbers show Obama gets his earmark number correct.\n"

            "claim": "\"Most U.S. foreign assistance ... is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants.\"",
            "evidence": "President Donald Trump\u2019s budget director Mike Mulvaney confirmed recently that foreign aid is on the chopping block. In an interview before the president\u2019s address to Congress, Mulvaney said Trump would help pay for an increase in defense spending with \"fairly dramatic reductions in foreign aid.\" Critics of programs that aim to boost economies, increase education and otherwise give poorer nations a leg up often say such aid is wasted through corruption and poor design. While Trump himself indicated during the campaign that some aid was warranted, in 2013 he tweeted, \"Every penny of the $7 billion going to Africa as per Obama will be stolen - corruption is rampant!\" The former head of the U.S. Agency for International Development Raj Shah wrote recently that such concerns about fraud and theft are way behind the times. \"Aid and development practitioners know how to set smart targets, engage private-sector partners, adapt to changing circumstances and make sure taxpayers get the most value for their investments,\" Shah wrote in a Feb. 24 Washington Post op-ed. \"Most U.S. foreign assistance no longer even goes to foreign governments. It is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants; these organizations then implement projects in other countries, employing a combination of American and foreign staff members and often partnering with institutions of civil society.\" We wondered if, in fact, most American aid goes to private companies and nonprofits, which then run programs in foreign countries. According to the Congressional Research Service, Shah is correct by a whopping margin. The nonpartisan research arm of Congress reported in 2015 that only 4 percent of USAID assistance goes directly to foreign governments. \"Most USAID funds go through U.S. partners \u2014 universities, NGOs, and contractors \u2014 although their efforts may directly assist a government\u2019s ministries\u00a0of education or health, for example, in providing educational and health programs to their public,\" the report said. The report said that, collectively, 49 percent of aid flows through American nonprofits, for-profit companies and American educational institutions. Another 29 percent goes to international organizations such as the Global Fund and various United Nations agencies. The domestic share is likely even higher. Shah is a fellow at the aid advocacy group Results for America. Staff there cited a specialty trade publication article that found that in 2015, the top 20 recipients of USAID funding were American organizations and \"these transactions account for 70 percent of the total USAID spending for obligated contracts for the year.\" Not all assistance flows through USAID, but it accounts for over 60 percent of the total. This pattern began to take shape in the mid 1970s as Washington shifted from financing large infrastructure projects to programs more directly aimed at helping the poor. Technical assistance replaced bricks and mortar. There has been a growing emphasis on health, most significantly the President\u2019s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). According to a 2013 report on all PEPFAR funding streams, as of 2008, 22 of the top 25 contractors were based in the United States. In 2016, the United States spent about $3.4 billion on health-related programs and about $2.9 billion on humanitarian assistance, according to the government\u2019s website on foreign aid. Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, told us the general pattern of working through the private sector holds across all of the agencies that oversee the aid budget, including the State and Agriculture Departments. \"The checks and controls in the procurement system are quite sound,\" Morris said. \"There is this culture of measurement and transparency that is more common today. Our foreign assistance programs are much more steeped in trying to measure what are we getting for our money. We\u2019ve gone beyond protecting against corruption.\" Our ruling Former USAID administrator Shah said that most U.S. foreign assistance goes to private companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants. According to the Congressional Budget Office, USAID, the government\u2019s largest agency for non-military aid, spends about 4 percent of its funds on direct aid to foreign governments. A trade publication reported that 70 percent of the agency\u2019s money ran through U.S.-based organizations. The use of contracts and grants has grown over the past three decades. An independent aid analyst said the general pattern at USAID applies across the other government offices that oversee foreign assistance."

            "evidence": "\nAfter a Democrat\u2019s filibuster derailed legislation considered essential by the Republican-steered Legislature, state Rep. Jason Isaac said the gambit had a cost. \"Back to work tomorrow. Per diem alone costs taxpayers $27,300/day,\" the Dripping Springs Republican tweeted May 30. \nNearly $30,000 a day? \nAs legislators started the 30-day special session immediately called by Gov. Rick Perry, Ellen Troxclair, Isaac\u2019s chief of staff, told us Isaac based his figure on information from the Texas Ethics Commission. \nSome background: A provision in the Texas Constitution provides for each legislator and the lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate, to receive a $600 monthly salary, mileage reimbursements and the per diem, which is a stipend intended to ease lawmaker living expenses while they\u2019re in Austin on state business each day during regular and special sessions. The commission, established in 1991, sets the per diem and also may recommend raises for legislators to voters, though that\u2019s not happened. \nAccording to information on the commission\u2019s website, the current legislative per diem is $150. \nSo, counting the 150 Texas House members, 31 senators and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, 182 lawmakers qualify for the payment each day lawmakers are in session. Total potential daily cost: $27,300. \nAccording to the Texas State Historical Association, the Constitution of 1876 set a legislator\u2019s compensation at $5 per day for the first 60 days of a regular session and $2 for each day after. A 1930 constitutional amendment changed the per diem to $10 for the first 120 days of the session and $5 after. During special sessions, the per diem was $10. A 1954 amendment raised the per diem to no more than $25 for the first 120 days of the regular session, while a 1960 amendment greenlighted paying legislators an annual salary of up to $4,800 plus a $12 per diem during the first 120 days of each regular session and each day of the special session. \nPer diem amounts inched up in later years with the commission setting the rate at $168 in January 2009, according to a Nov. 12 2010, news story in the Austin American-Statesman. But after the commission proposed authorizing the same rate members of the 2011 Legislature, Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus called for the rate to be lowered to $150 in a Nov. 29, 2010 letter stating the move would help the state tighten overall spending. \nDo lawmakers ever pass up the per diem? \nPatsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, told us that no senators have declined the payments since 2003 when Senate Democrats fled to New Mexico to impede the passage of redistricting legislation. \nSteven Adrian, executive director of the House Business Office, told us no representatives have submitted a request to withhold or reduce per diem payments this session. \nIsaac\u2019s statement adds up to True."

            "claim": "Virginia \"spends less per student today than we did in 2008.\"",
            "evidence": "\nHouse Minority Leader David Toscano called on the state government to increase funding for public schools during his Democratic response to Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s State of the Commonwealth address.\n\n\"We spend less per student today than we did in 2008,\" Toscano, D-Charlottesville, said in his Jan. 9 speech.\n\nWe wondered if Toscano is right.\n\nCarmen Bingham, Toscano\u2019s chief of staff, told us the claim was based on a Senate Finance Committee report from November that contained a graph breaking down the state\u2019s general fund spending on schools over 10 years. The general fund is largely supported by sales and income tax dollars and mostly used to pay for education, public safety and health programs.\n\nMany Democrats in recent years have opposed Republican efforts to expand a small portion of the general fund used for transportation, saying that would strip money from public schools.\n\nThe graph shows that in fiscal 2008, which ended June 30 of that year, Virginia spent $4,451 per\nstudent. During this fiscal year, the state will spend $4,286 per student from the general fund. The $165 per pupil decrease is about 3.7 percent. Adjusted for inflation, the drop is about 11.4 percent.\n\nThe drop corresponds with Virginia\u2019s fall into the national recession midway through fiscal 2008. Revenues from the sales tax and income tax plunged and have been slow to recover. The general fund fell from $17 billion in 2008 to $14.8 billion in 2010. It has climbed back and this year is expected to hit $17.1 billion. Some of the losses in revenue were temporarily patched with stimulus money from the federal government.\n\nThe general funds going to education have followed a similar arc, although they have not returned to their level of five years ago. In 2008, $5.3 billion went to education. That dropped to $4.7 billion in 2011 and this year is budgeted at $5.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of students in Virginia public schools has grown by 30,000 -- from 1.19 million in 2008 to 1.22 million this school year.\n\nThe education cuts were made in state budgets that were backed by majorities of Democrats and Republicans. The cuts largely came in the way of reduced funding for support positions -- such as guidance counselors, nurses, secretaries -- and by easing some education standards that the state had taken responsibility for funding, according to the Senate Finance Committee report. \u00a0\n\nWe should note that the graph Toscano sent us does not give a complete picture of state funding for public education. It omits about $630 million each year of non-general state funds that are spent on schools each year, about three-quarters of which come from lottery profits.\n\nWe wondered whether per-student spending is still lower than the 2008 level when the total amount of state aid for schools is considered. The answer is yes.\n\nIn the 2008 school year, the state put a total $5.96 billion into education and spent an average of $5,003 per student. This school year, Virginia has budgeted $5.83 billion for schools, or an average of $4,774 per student.\n\nAll told, state funding has dropped by $229 per student since -- or 4.6 percent -- since 2008. Adjusted for inflation, the decrease is about 12.2 percent..\n\nWe should note that the state pays an total about 44 percent of public education costs. Local governments pay about 49 percent, the remaining \u00a07 percent comes from the federal government.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBy any measure, the state is spending less per public school student this year than it did in 2008."

            "evidence": "\nIn a speech defending his plans for the detainess at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, President Barack Obama said Americans should not be concerned about them being transferred to the United States because federal prisons are secure.\n \n\"Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders \u2014 highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety,\" Obama said. \"Bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal '\nsupermax\n' prisons.\"\n \nFirst, we should note that Obama's comment suggests there is more than one federal\n\"supermax\n\" facility. But there's actually just one, the Administration Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Some states have built their own maximum security prisons, but it's clear Obama was referring to federal facilities because they would be the ones to house the suspected terrorists.\n \nThe security of the \"Alcatraz of the Rockies,\" as the Florence prison is known among correctional program professionals, has been cited frequently by Democrats as lawmakers and the administration battle over where to relocate the detainees. Obama is seeking to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010.\n \nMany Republicans believe it should remain open, and many Democrats have also grown wary. A bipartisan group of lawmakers blocked funding to close the facility until Obama comes up with a more detailed plan on what would happen to the detainees.\n \nMeanwhile, some Senate Democrats, including Assistant Majority Leader Richard\nDurbin\nand California Sen. Dianne\nFeinstein\n, have suggested that\na supermax\nprison is the best place to house the suspected terrorists.\n\n\nAs you might expect, living is austere at the Alcatraz of the Rockies. Prisoners are kept in small cells and have limited contact with others. Florence is already home to several widely known international and domestic terrorists, including the \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid, and\nZacarias\nMoussaoui\n, a man sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks.\n \nAs for Obama's statement, federal prison officials confirmed that he is correct. No prisoner has ever escaped from the only federal\nsupermax\nfacility since it was opened in 1994, no doubt thanks to the $10 million perimeter fence and the remote-controlled steel doors. We find his statement True.\n"

            "claim": "Alabama\u2019s Crimson Tide will be the underdog in Saturday\u2019s game against the Georgia Bulldogs, the first time in 72 consecutive games that Alabama has not been favored by oddsmakers to win.",
            "evidence": "ESPN and other news outlets are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide likely will have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. Alabama hasn\u2019t walked on the field as the underdog in 72 consecutive games -- \u00a0not since the SEC Championship against Florida in 2009, ESPN reported. Even then, as five-point underdogs, the Crimson Tide rolled over the Gators, 32-13. The team went on to win the national championship and has been favored by the oddsmakers to win every game since then --- until now. It is the longest such streak in modern college history, according to ESPN college football insider Phil Steele. That\u2019s quite a claim -- one that caused PolitiFact Georgia to decide to temporarily step out of its comfort zone, truth-squading politicians and newsmakers, and check. So when Nick Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide roll into Sanford Stadium in Athens on Saturday, will they really be the underdog pick for the first time in 72 games? Or is that just more hype about the Bama-Bulldog rivalry? These two teams first met back in 1895 and have battled it out 66 times over the years, with Alabama coming out on top 37 times. Saturday\u2019s game marks the first time the Crimson Tide has visited Athens since 2008, when Georgia trailed 31-0 at halftime before losing 41-30. Underdog status isn\u2019t a subject to be broached with university officials in Alabama, Georgia, or any state for that matter. That\u2019s because it\u2019s based on whether a team is or isn\u2019t a betting favorite with Vegas oddsmakers, and betting in any form is against NCAA regulations. On Thursday, UGA was a 2.5-point \u00a0at William Hill\u2019s Nevada sportsbook. David Purdum, who covers the gambling industry as a staff writer for ESPN Chalk, told PolitiFact how he did his calculations. Using one of several online college football preview magazines, Purdum looked at Alabama\u2019s record against the spread since 2010 (36-34-1). The Tide\u2019s streak as predicted game winner started with the national championship game against Texas in 2009, so adding that to the 71 games since 2010 is how Purdum, who also freelances as a high school sports reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, came up with the count of a record 72 games in a row. He also cross-checked the info with ESPN\u2019s Stats & Information Department, he said. For this Saturday\u2019s sellout game Between the Hedges in Athens, OddsShark.com had No. 8 ranked Georgia (4-0, 2-0 SEC) favored by a 2.5-point spread. And underdog status could still turn by kickoff on Saturday, depending on how the final betting goes. A win Saturday against No. 13 rated Alabama (3-1, 0-1 SEC) would be a huge boost for the Bulldogs. A loss could mean another second-tier bowl season for University of Coach Mark Richt\u2019s program. But atAt a press conference Tuesday, Georgia Head Coach Mark Richt wasn\u2019t talking like Alabama is the game\u2019s underdog. \"They're as good or better than they've ever been, in my opinion,\" he said of Alabama. The Crimson Tide rarely finds itself in a must-win situation this early in the season. But a second straight conference loss would be devastating for the team's playoff chances, while a win would put Alabama right back on track with home dates in three of the team's next four games. Our ruling ESPN and others are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide will likely have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. That\u2019s based on the fact that for 72 games in a row Alabama was favored in betting to win. And that wasn\u2019t the case this week as bets started being placed for the game Saturday at Sanford Stadium. But since betting goes on down to the wire, there\u2019s at least a possibility that the underdog status could change up to game time. That\u2019s why they call it gambling. And given the unknown, we have to hedge a bit ourselves at this stage of the game."

            "claim": "\"Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin.\"",
            "evidence": "\nDuring a town hall on health care, an audience member asked President Barack Obama about the cost of health care reform, and whether the government could afford to do it.\n \nObama's answer was a variation on the sales pitch, Can you afford\n\nnot\n\nto?\n \n\"I think it's a very legitimate question,\" Obama began. \"I guess that the first point I'd make is, if we don't do anything, costs are going to go out of control. Nobody disputes this. Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin.\"\n \nIf we don't do something soon to rein in health care costs, Obama said, Medicare and Medicaid \"will consume all of the federal budget.\"\n \nWe decided to check his statement that \"Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin.\"\n \nWe consulted a number of experts, both left-leaning and right-leaning, and they agreed that over the long term, Medicare and Medicaid, along with Social Security \u2014 the programs popularly known as \"entitlements\" \u2014 will indeed overwhelm the federal budget and are the main drivers of the deficit. (Of the three programs, Medicare is the largest by a significant margin.)\n \nBut there's also some explaining to do about Obama's statement.\n \nWhen he talks about Medicare and Medicaid driving the deficit, he's not talking about 2009. The 2009 deficit will be powered primarily by the economic downturn, both spending on stimulus and bailouts, and lost tax revenues from the lack of economic activity. The Bush tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the recent Medicare prescription drug benefit have also created gaps between spending and revenues in recent years.\n \nBut Obama's singling out of Medicare and Medicaid is true over a much longer window of time, say, over the next 50 to 75 years.\n \nNow, that may strike you \u2014 as it did us \u2014 as too far in the future to worry about. But the economists we spoke to are definitely worried about it right now.\n \nA coalition of diverse think tanks \u2014 the Concord Coalition, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Heritage Foundation \u2014 teamed up several years ago for a \"Fiscal Wake Up Tour\" to alert people across the political spectrum about the poor outlook for the budget over the long term.\n \n\"Unless lawmakers promptly reform Social Secu\u00adrity, Medicare, and Medicaid, America faces a future of soaring taxes and government spending that will cause poor economic performance,\" wrote Brian Riedl, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, who participated in the tour.\n \n\"Americans will pay onerous taxes, and future generations will have lower living standards than Americans enjoy today,\" he said. \"The longer lawmakers wait to enact the necessary reforms, the more painful those reforms will be.\"\n \nHow bad could things get? The nonpartisan Concord Coalition, citing data models from the Government Accountability Office, found that by 2027, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and net interest would consume all revenues collected by the federal government. By 2047, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone would consume all revenues. By 2052, the model is untenable, because the economy is in ruins.\n\nGulp!\n\n \nSo if Obama is right that Medicare and Medicaid are driving the deficit, then health care reform can fix the long-term deficit, right?\n \nWrong.\n \n\"We have to do everything we can on the health care side, and then certainly there's going to be even more that we have to do,\" said James Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Don't assume we can wave the wand on health care reform and that will take care of everything.\"\n \nObama has said many times that he wants health care reform to slow the growth of health care spending. But note the words slow the\n\ngrowth\u00a0\n\n\u2014 that doesn't mean a reduction in overall health care spending.\n \n\"Even if we significantly cut back the growth in health spending every year for the next 75 years, we still need more revenues to pay for our current obligations,\" said Ben Harris, a senior research associate at Brookings and the Tax Policy Center. \"There's a need for a dramatic cut in spending or some way to raise more revenue, whether it's a new tax or raising an existing tax.\"\n \nThat's where the economists disagree: Whether to cut spending or raise taxes. But we found little disagreement over the underlying problem.\n \nSo going back to Obama's statement, Obama said, \"Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin.\" But we do need to add the caveat that Medicare and Medicaid growth is a long-term problem, not what's driving the deficits of this year or the next few years.\n"

            "claim": "\"In Oregon, women earn an average of 79 cents for every dollar that men earn for doing the same job. That\u2019s just wrong.\"",
            "evidence": "Income inequality has emerged as a significant issue heading into the 2014 campaign season. One hot-button piece of that debate focuses on what some politicians, researchers and economists call the gender pay gap. In his recent State of the Union address, President Barack Obama mentioned the gap when he said that, nationally, women earn an average of 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. In Oregon, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian posted an \"issue statement\" on his campaign website on Jan. 31, 2014, that customizes the issue for the Beaver state. \"In Oregon,\" according to the post, \"women earn an average of 79 cents for every dollar that men earn for doing the same job. That\u2019s just wrong.\" We agree, that would be quite the disparity. But is it accurate? We checked. We called Avakian\u2019s office and spoke with Charlie Burr, communications director for the state Bureau of Labor and Industries, which Avakian oversees. Burr said the claim is based on statistics included in the fall 2013 edition of \"The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap\" issued by the American Association of University Women. A table in the report lists, by gender and state, median annual earnings and earnings ratios of men to women for full-time, year-round workers ages 16 and older. The information, drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey, showed that men in Oregon earned $47,402 in 2012, compared with $37,381 for women. We checked the Census information ourselves and found the information was accurate. That put the income earned by women at 79 percent of their male counterparts. The table showed that, nationally, the figure is 77 percent. PolitiFact National has already looked into this issue, so we checked the most recent offering, which, in analyzing Obama's State of the Union address, called the president\u2019s 77-cent ratio \u00a0\"a credible figure from a credible agency.\" The wording of Obama\u2019s and Avakian\u2019s claims, however, is problematic, PolitiFact National has found. That work determined that adding the words for the same work or in the same job slightly weakened the claims\u2019 accuracy. One reason is that federal agencies aren\u2019t entirely in agreement when it comes to tracking such statistics. The Census Bureau, for instance, tracks annual wages. That information yields the 77-cent figure. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, meanwhile, tracks weekly wages. Broken down that way, women earn 82 cents for every dollar men make. What\u2019s the difference? The weekly analysis does not account for people who are self-employed, PolitiFact found, but does include some left out of the annual measure, such as some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. The gap narrows more -- to 86 cents -- if hourly rates are used, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data because those account for part-time workers, who include a larger percentage of women than men. We called Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based nonpartisan think tank. \"The hourly figures still show there is a wage gap,\" she said, \"but they still don\u2019t suggest that the 77-cent figure or Oregon\u2019s 79-cent figure are wrong. They are just looking at different measures.\" Nothing has shown that any gap is solely because of workplace discrimination, Hegewisch said. But studies controlling for factors such as level of education, hours worked and sector of work still leave 25 to 40 percent of the gap explainable only by discrimination, Hegewisch said. \"There are shades and important nuances here,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not based on taking two people literally in the same firm and saying, \u2018Are you being paid more or not?\u2019 It\u2019s also who gets hired at all. It\u2019s still the case that the highest-paying firms tend to hire more young white guys than young anybody else.\" Different pay for different work also plays a part, Hegewisch said. Laborers, who tend to be men, usually make more than, say, nursing aides, who tend to be women, she said. \"It comes down to more of a social issue of how we judge the value of different occupations.\" Avakian, citing Census data and echoing claims by Obama and others, said women in Oregon \"earn an average of 79 cents for every dollar that men earn for doing the same job.\" The report he relied on noted that the 79-cent figure applies to full-time, year-round work, although Avakian didn\u2019t include those stipulations. For starters, the commissioner loses points for cherry-picking the 79-cent figure. Other means of measuring pay gaps between men and women put it considerably less. The same can be said of the \"for doing the same job\" piece. As PolitiFact has found previously, the existence of a pay gap doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all of the gap is caused by individual employer-level discrimination, as Avakian\u2019s claim implies. Some of the gap is at least partially explained by the predominance of women in lower-paying fields, rather than women necessarily being paid less for the same job than men are. Finally, Avakian used the term \"average\" when the report he relied on said \"median.\" He could have avoided that by simply saying women \"make 79 cents for every dollar a man earns,\" but since the information he cited contains only median incomes, we find the difference to be inconsequential. Those caveats aside, he still is well inside the ballpark and the ratio he cited is a credible figure from a credible agency. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling."

            "claim": "\"At (Mike Braun\u2019s) company, the deductible on his health care is $10,000.\"",
            "evidence": "Incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly painted himself as a guardian of health insurance and Republican opponent Mike Braun as its main threat during their first debate. \"I was the final vote to save health care,\" Donnelly said of his opposition to the so-called skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \"At (Braun\u2019s) company, the deductible on his health care if $10,000, which is completely unaffordable. He has every time tried to take away pre-existing conditions coverage and supports the lawsuit today that would do that.\" Braun did not respond to the attack in the debate, but in his rebuttal he said he \"took on health care\" and \"held premiums for 10 years while covering pre-existing conditions. But when it comes to his business, Meyer Distributing, does Braun charge $10,000 deductibles? Meyer Distributing is an auto parts distribution company. According to Braun\u2019s campaign, the company had 452 employees in Indiana as of April. The majority make between $10 and $17 an hour. The employee benefits enrollment guide from 2018 confirms family deductibles are $10,000, and $5,000 for individuals. The health plan is valid from March 1, 2018, to Feb. 28, 2019. We were unable to find any other health plans offered, and the Braun campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Meyer offers a high-deductible health plan. That means that health care costs are absorbed by the employee until they reach that set limit (of $5,000 or $10,000). Doctor\u2019s office visits, prescriptions and emergency room visits are not covered until then. Preventive care costs, on the other hand, are fully covered regardless of whether the deductible has been met. Those include annual preventive physicals and tests, routine prenatal care, immunizations, and screening services. The individual deductible roughly doubles national averages, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation published on Oct. 3. The 2018 average for individuals was $2,349 and $4,676 for families. Meyer\u2019s plan is still within the limits set by the Affordable Care Act, which caps out-of-pocket costs at $7,350 for an individual plan and $14,700 for a family. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that on average, employers that offer such plans contribute more than $1,000 to employees\u2019 health savings accounts. We found no indication in the guide whether Meyer contributes or not. Premiums at Meyer, however, were lower than the national average. That\u2019s the money employees pay for health care coverage with each paycheck, if enrolled. Workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for individuals, or $198.44 for the employee, spouse and children, which translates to $891.80 and $5,159.44 a year, respectively. The national average worker contribution to the premium is $1,074 for individuals and $4,631 for families. Braun said he has held premiums steady for 10 years. Individual premiums are lower\u00a0at Meyer than the national average dating back to 2010. Average premiums have been increasing each year, so keeping premiums steady for 10 years would be unusual, according to Pollitz. \"Firms have been moderating premium increases by shifting more costs to workers in the form of deductibles,\" Pollitz said. \"That\u2019s a good deal for the worker as long as they don\u2019t get sick, hurt or pregnant.\" Donnelly said, \"At (Braun\u2019s) company, the deductible on his health care is $10,000.\" The high-deductible health plan Braun offered full-time employees in 2018 had deductibles of $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for families."

            "evidence": "Sen. John McCain, trying to make a case at a church forum that Americans should feel protective of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, cited its significance in Christian history.\n \n\"I am very saddened here to be with you and talk about Russian re-emergence in the centuries-old ambition of the Russian Empire to dominate that part of the world,\" McCain told the Rev. Rick Warren at Saddleback Valley Community Church in California on Aug. 16, 2008. \"Killings, murder, villages are being burned, people are being wantonly ejected from their homes. The latest figures from human rights organizations \u2014 118,000 people in that small country. It was one of the earliest Christian nations. The king of then-Georgia in the third century converted to Christianity.\"\n \nMcCain characterized Georgia similarly on other occasions.\n \n\"Georgia is an ancient country, at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and one of the world's first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion,\" McCain said in a campaign statement on Aug. 11, 2008.\n \nIt is true that what is now Eastern Georgia, then known as Kartli, adopted Christianity quite early.\n\nSt. Nino\n\n\n\n, the Apostle of Georgia, introduced Christianity to the country in the 300s, converting King Marian III in 314, according to Ronald Suny, a professor of history at the University of Michigan and author of the 1988 book\n\nThe Making of the Georgian Nation.\n\n \n\"When the king converted he forced everyone else to become Christian,\" Suny said. \"That's the year before the Roman Empire became Christian.\"\n \nSo yes, Georgia was indeed an early adopter of Christianity. Note, however, this did not happen in the third century as McCain said. The first century lasted through the year 100, the second through 200, and the third through 300. Georgia became a Christian state in 314, which was the fourth century.\n \nAlso, scholars quibble with McCain's use of the word \"nation.\" In common parlance and under some dictionary definitions, a nation can be any territorial division. But a more subtle understanding is a group of people who believe they are entitled to some form of political representation, and thus give authority and legitimacy to a government. This concept arose in the 18th and 19th centuries. Prior to that, there were empires, dynastic states, theocracies, kingdoms and so forth, but not nations.\n \n\"To claim that whatever entity 'Georgia' may have been in the third century was a 'nation' is factually anachronistic,\" John Pilch, a professor of biblical literature at Georgetown University told us in an e-mail exchange. (Furthermore, he said, the word \"Christian\" was not fashionable at the time of the Georgian king's conversion \u2014 Christians at that time might have referred to themselves as \"followers of the Way.\")\n \nThese are quibbles though. A fair reading of the thrust of McCain's claim is that the place we call Georgia was an early adopter of Christianity, and that's true. He didn't use the word \"nation\" perfectly and he flubbed his centuries, but his claim is still Mostly True.\n"

            "claim": "A mansion in photo is Joe Biden\u2019s house.",
            "evidence": "Social media users are circulating a claim about a house purportedly owned by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and questioning how he could afford it on a government salary. Eric Trump, President Donald Trump\u2019s son, tweeted the aerial-view photo of the Delaware mansion with this comment: \"The salary of a U.S. senator is $174,000 per year. This is Joe Biden\u2019s house. ... seems legit.\" The tweet has been shared more than 50,000 times. The salary of a U.S. senator rose to $174,000 in 2009, the year Biden left the chamber to become vice president. But Eric Trump\u2019s tweet juxtaposed that figure with the photo of a mansion that hasn\u2019t belonged to Biden in nearly 25 years. Biden bought the house in 1975 for $185,000, then sold it in 1996 after major renovations. The image comes from a Wall Street Journal article about Biden\u2019s real estate investments. Wall Street Journal staffers confirmed they used Pictometry, an aerial imaging service, to download the satellite image of the property. The same article reported that Biden purchased the DuPont mansion in 1975 for $185,000, and sold it in 1996 for $1.2 million. He does not currently own it.\u00a0 A parcel search for the Delaware address on New Castle County\u2019s website confirmed that Biden sold the property in 1996. The New York Times also reported the sale in a 2008 article, which said Biden initially bought the property after he learned it was slated for demolition.\u00a0 The Eric Trump tweet cites a Senate salary figure of $174,000 to suggest that the mansion would have been beyond Biden\u2019s means. Biden\u2019s salary as a senator varied from $42,500 a year when he began serving in the Senate in 1973, to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. As vice president, he earned up to $230,700 a year, and his wife, Jill, continued her teaching career.\u00a0 But after he left office, both Bidens wrote books, and his financial disclosure form lists dozens of speaking engagements and book-tour events that typically earned him five- and six-figure payments each. The couple, who file their taxes jointly, reported adjusted gross income of about $11 million in 2017. Biden\u2019s campaign confirmed that he owns two Delaware properties, a house on a 4-acre lakefront lot in Wilmington and a vacation house on Rehoboth Beach, Del. The campaign also directed PolitiFact to Richard Ben Cramer\u2019s book, \"What It Takes,\" which describes some of the work Biden put into the home he sold. The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The tweet claimed that a photo of a Delaware mansion was Biden\u2019s current home, and appears to question how he paid for the property with a senator\u2019s salary. Biden bought the mansion in 1975 for $185,000, when his salary was about $42,500, then sold it in 1996 for $1.2 million after a renovation. He does not live there."

            "claim": "\"Florida sheriffs unequivocally support\" the \"stand your ground\"\u00a0law.",
            "evidence": "Florida\u2019s \"stand your ground\" law has been controversial both statewide and nationally since the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. But Florida legislators show no sign of backing away from it. The\u00a0Florida\u00a0House Criminal Justice Subcommittee rejected a repeal of the law during a five-hour meeting Nov. 7, 2013. The hearing was led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, who had previously vowed not to change \"one damn comma\" of the law. At the hearing, supporters and critics lined up to speak about the law. Among the supporters are sheriffs, said Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley. \"Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to stand your ground,\" said the sheriff from northwest Florida. Ashley said that the \"stand your ground\" law expanded the \"castle doctrine\" -- the right for people to defend themselves at home -- to other places, including their neighborhood and the mall. \"Florida sheriffs stand behind this law and oppose the repeal of it,\" said Ashley, who served on the task force formed by Gov. Rick Scott to examine the law after Trayon's death. The dictionary defines \"unequivocal\" as \"admitting of no doubt or misunderstanding; clear and unambiguous.\" Ashley\u2019s statement could leave listeners with the impression that Florida sheriffs\u2019 have no doubts about the stand your ground law. Is that correct? Sheriffs\u00a0association vote on \u2018stand your ground\u2019 The \"stand your ground\"\u00a0law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. Trayvon, of Miami Gardens, was shot in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012, by George Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighborhood watchman. The \"stand your ground\" law was cited in the jury instructions, and in July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree\u00a0murder. The law became a touchstone in the debate about Trayvon's death. About a month after the acquittal, the Florida Sheriffs Association issued a press release\u00a0expressing support for the law. \"The right to self-defense is well-established in law,\" stated the Aug. 9 press release. \"The Florida Sheriffs confirmed this position by voting unanimously, at the 2013 Florida Sheriffs Association Summer Conference, to support the 'stand your ground' law as it is currently written. Our current judicial system is comprised of multiple checks and balances to ensure fair and equitable application of all laws, including 'stand your ground.' \" Ashley, who participated in the vote, told PolitiFact Florida that none of the sheriffs voiced opposition to the law during the association\u2019s meeting at Marco Island in August. \"As with any issue you can only measure support or opposition to a position when it is voiced at the time of its measurement,\" Ashley told PolitiFact Florida in an email. But some news reports about the association\u2019s announcement questioned whether it was accurate to describe the vote as \"unanimous.\" For starters, it was unclear how many sheriffs voted. The association reported that 57 of its\u00a066 sheriffs registered for the conference, but the association didn\u2019t record the number who participated in the vote -- some may have left before the vote or didn\u2019t participate in it. \"It was a large number of sheriffs,\" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, the association president, told PolitiFact Florida. \"I can\u2019t tell you if it was 57, 52, 55. It is a well-attended session because that\u2019s where we discuss things among ourselves that are of some importance.\" News reports indicated that some sheriffs -- including from large urban counties including Broward, Hillsborough and Orange -- didn\u2019t participate in the vote and that a few sheriffs had some reservations about the law. Judd told PolitiFact that there was no written agenda that notified sheriffs ahead of time that they would take a vote on the \"stand your ground\" law. Judd said that sheriffs had heard that House Speaker Will Weatherford wanted input from law enforcement about the law, and that that\u2019s what prompted the vote. Judd couldn\u2019t recall for certain if he was the sheriff who brought up the topic, but he added that it might have been him. (Judd was elevated to the group\u2019s presidency during the conference.) There was no written motion about the vote, but Judd said the wording was essentially: \"Do you support Florida\u2019s 'stand your ground' law?\" \"It was a unanimous vote and there was not a voice in opposition,\" Judd said. Judd said he was frustrated that news reports questioned his description of the vote as \"unanimous.\" \"Some reporters say \u2018you didn\u2019t have 100 percent of Florida sheriffs.\u2019 You are missing the issue. We had 100 percent vote of the ones in the room that voted. ... It\u2019s kind of like election day -- you don\u2019t show up and vote, your vote doesn\u2019t count.\" Judd said the association\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t stop any individual sheriffs from advocating for their personal views about the law. Sheriffs could weigh in again at their conference in February shortly before the legislative session. Some sheriffs have raised concerns about the law The vote is one thing; subsequent comments by sheriffs are another. We found news reports about seven sheriffs, a mix of Democrats and Republicans, who either raised concerns about the law or whose position about the law was unclear. In some cases, these sheriffs didn\u2019t participate in the association\u2019s vote. PolitiFact Florida contacted spokespersons for those sheriffs. Here\u2019s a summary of our findings: Broward County: The Sun-Sentinel reported that Sheriff Scott Israel wasn\u2019t at the Florida Sheriffs Association conference due to National Night Out events in Broward. Israel told the Sentinel in August that had he attended, \"I would have voted against the FSA statement on the 'stand your ground' law. I support an individual's right to use armed self-defense when faced with the immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury, and without requiring any duty to retreat in one's own home. However, if there is a safe opportunity in other settings to retreat and de-escalate potentially deadly violence, it should be done. For this reason, I support legislative changes to more narrowly restrict the use of the 'stand your ground' defense.\" Israel expressed support for \"fixing serious flaws\" in the law in an October op-ed in the Sun-Sentinel. Pinellas County: Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told PolitiFact Florida in an email, \"I was unclear as to exactly what was being asked in the motion,\" at the association meeting. \"I did not verbalize a response when the voice vote was called.\" Gualtieri said that he \"unequivocally\" supports the broad concept of the \"stand your ground\" law. However, he said there is room for discussion about some adjustments. \"I do not support the application of SYG immunity in circumstances where the person against whom deadly force was used was totally unarmed with any type of weapon when the force was used,\" Gualtieri said. \"I also do not believe that someone deemed to be a 'primary aggressor'\u00a0should be able to assert SYG \u2014 one does not get to pick the fight and then end it with deadly force.\" Hillsborough: The Tampa Tribune reported that Sheriff David Gee attended the conference but left before the vote. (We confirmed that directly with a spokeswoman.) He said he \"wouldn't have voted that way without hearing the state attorneys out on that issue.\" \u00a0 In July 2012, Gee sent a response to an NRA questionnaire in which he declined to provide his personal opinion about self defense. \"The Legislature has spoken on this issue,\" he wrote. \"HCSO deputies always follow the law.\" Orange: A spokesman for Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told PolitiFact Florida that Demings attended the meeting but had to leave early to attend National Night Out events. The spokesman sent us a previous statement by Demings: \"Had I been present, I likely would not have supported the vote. As a member of the Citizen Safety and Protection Task Force appointed by Governor Scott last year, I stand by the recommendations of the Task Force.\" Volusia and Flagler counties: The News Service of Florida reported that the sheriffs in Volusia and Flagler counties expressed reservations about the law. A spokesman for Volusia Sheriff Ben Johnson told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Johnson was in the room for the vote but did not participate in it. Johnson, a past president of the association, stands behind the association\u2019s position on the law, but added that \"his personal position differs slightly from that of the association. The sheriff supports the right of citizens to employ deadly force with no duty to retreat in order to defend themselves while in their homes or vehicles. However, when out in the open and facing a threat, the sheriff believes citizens should attempt to retreat if possible before using lethal force. He has consistently stated this position and supports the law, but believes it would be improved with the addition of three words (retreat if possible) as it relates to locations other than homes or vehicles.\" Meanwhile, Flagler County Sheriff Jim Manfre, according to the News Service of Florida, \"said the association's take doesn't exactly match his personal view. Manfre said he thinks the castle doctrine should remain on the books and the rest be repealed.\" (Manfre had no additional comment for PolitiFact Florida, his spokesman said.) Miami-Dade: Miami-Dade is the most populous county in the state and home to Trayvon, but J.D. Patterson -- the county\u2019s appointed police director, the equivalent of an elected sheriff -- does not appear to have commented publicly about \"stand your ground.\" According to Huffington Post, a spokesperson for Patterson confirmed that he attended the conference but couldn\u2019t say if he voted. \"Director J.D. Patterson was there and he does not wish to discuss the issue,\" Det. Alvaro Zabaleta told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Our ruling During a legislative hearing about Florida\u2019s controversial \"stand your ground\" law, Okaloosa Sheriff Larry Ashley said \"Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to 'stand your ground.' \" The Florida Sheriffs Association did take a voice vote in August that the association reported was unanimous in support of the current \"stand your ground\" law. But no more than 57 of the state\u2019s 66 sheriffs voted (and quite likely fewer) and a number of sheriffs, including those representing some of the state\u2019s most populous counties, have spoken publicly or to PolitiFact Florida about their reservations about the law. Ashley\u2019s comments left readers with the impression that the support among Florida is \"unequivocal,\" or unambiguous, but that\u2019s not the case."

            "claim": "\"Our road conditions cost WI families. In Milwaukee, the average cost per driver is $2,300.\"",
            "evidence": "Now that the snow has cleared, it\u2019s time to switch our thoughts from winter to the next season: Orange barrel season. In his 2019-\u201921 budget, Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 transportation plan calls for bringing in an additional $520 million over two years from an increased gas tax and higher transportation fees. In supporting Evers\u2019 spending plan, some Democrats have noted the rough conditions of local roads. \"Our road conditions cost WI families,\" state Sen. LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, said April 3, 2019 on Twitter. \"In Milwaukee, the average cost per driver is $2,300. Our families simply cannot afford for us to continue to kick the can down the road. We need a sustainable transportation funding solution.\" Is Johnson right about how much bad roads are costing drivers in Milwaukee? Not exactly. Several studies we reviewed all rated the road conditions in the city -- and the state -- poorly. But Johnson far overstates the amount of the cost that is due to those bad conditions.\" Evers\u2019 budget would bump the state\u2019s gas tax from 32.9 cents per gallon to 40.9 cents. Starting in April 2020, the gas tax would automatically go up by an inflationary amount every year \u2014 reinstating a policy known as indexing that lawmakers eliminated in 2005. The money is not all aimed at state highways. Part of Evers\u2019 transportation plan calls for giving local governments a 10 percent increase in aid to help them fill potholes and fix roads in their communities.That represents an increase of $66 million. \"We\u2019ll see a significant increase for counties and municipalities and to fix roads and bridges that frankly aren\u2019t part of the interstate system,\" Evers said in a Feb. 21, 2019 Wisconsin State Journal article. The evidence When asked for backup, Johnson chief of staff Lacy Fox directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a September \u00a02018 report compiled by the national transportation research group TRIP. The group is a nonprofit, but notes on its website it is sponsored by \"insurance companies, equipment manufacturers, distributors and suppliers; businesses involved in highway and transit engineering and construction; labor unions; and organizations concerned with efficient and safe surface transportation.\" So, it\u2019s interest is increased road spending. That said, the group\u2019s reports are cited by many media outlets, including the Washington Post and NBC News. TRIP calculated the cost to the average motorist per year in the state\u2019s largest urban areas in the form of additional vehicle operating costs as a result of driving on rough roads, the cost of lost time and wasted fuel due to congestion, and the financial cost of traffic crashes. Here is that breakdown: Eau Claire: $1,219 Green Bay-Appleton-Oshkosh: $1,456 Madison: $2,139 Milwaukee: $2,321 Wausau: $1,517 Those totals, though, include much more than costs tied directly to road conditions -- which was the focus of Johnson\u2019s tweet. If you focus more strictly on the condition of local roads -- which is what the Evers\u2019 proposal is aimed at improving -- you get a much smaller amount: Eau Claire: $665 Green Bay-Appleton-Oshkosh: $816 Madison: $910 Milwaukee: $944 Wausau: $885 Additional reports What\u2019s more, other entities that have examined the cost to drivers of road conditions found a similar amount. Teletrac Navman, a software company that specializes in fleet and asset management, ranked Milwaukee the fifth worst major urban area in the nation when it comes to road conditions. The Illinois-based firm put Milwaukee\u2019s annual vehicle maintenance costs at $861. That ranked the city seventh among major urban areas. Here is the top 10: Oklahoma City, Okla: $1,025 Tulsa, Okla.: $998 San Francisco-Oakland: $978 Los Angeles-Long Beach: $892 Detroit: $865 San Jose, Calif: \u00a0$863 Milwaukee: $861 Omaha, Neb.: $852 Bridgeport-Stamford, Conn.: $797 San Antonio: $791 Other studies involving Wisconsin and the nation found comparable costs. A 2019 report from the American Society of Civil Engineers shows poor condition public roads in Wisconsin are costing state drivers $736 each year. Based on data from a 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, conducted for all 50 states, the report noted that some of the high cost of driving on broken roads comes from wear and tear on car parts. A 2016 AAA (American Automobile Association) report narrows the cost of poor roads down even further, focusing only on pothole damage, noting that potholes on local roads costs American drivers $3 billion a year. It gives the annual average pothole-related cost to drivers as $300 in repairs. Those are further evidence that the claim made by Johnson is off the mark. Milwaukee spending In addition to the state spending, of course, the city picks up a large chunk of the cost of street repairs. Indeed, most of the city\u2019s streets are not eligible for outside funding. Here is a look at the breakdown and where the money is going in the 2019 budget: Major streets: These 286 miles of major and minor arterials are eligible for county, state, and federal funding. The 2019 budget includes $32.5 million for the major street program, of which $5.5 million is city funding. Local streets: Approximately 987 miles of city streets are typically not eligible for state and federal funding. In 2019, $6.2 million was included in the proposed budget for the resurfacing and reconstruction of local streets. In addition, $2.5 million was set aside for pothole patching and street maintenance. Another $5.6 million is earmarked for the \"high-impact\" program, which focused on quick curb-to-curb resurfacing of major streets, typically in commercial areas. Our rating In backing Evers\u2019 transportation plan, Johnson claimed road conditions in Milwaukee cost the average driver $2,300. TRIP, a frequently cited national nonprofit that researches and evaluates data on transportation issues, has generated a $2,321 per year figure for Milwaukee drivers. But that figure applies to a broader set of issues than strictly road conditions, which is what Johnson focused on. When the focus is on road conditions, TRIP\u2019s figure for Milwaukee is $944 per year -- one that is more in line with other studies on the cost of bad roads to drivers. Our definition for Mostly False is \"The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\" That fits here."

Because hospitals by law cannot refuse emergency care, uninsured patients may be left with no option beyond the E.R. even to treat minor health issues. Yet this is an expensive solution for the health care system, since E.R. care costs much more than routine medical care dispensed by general practitioners. By increasing insurance coverage, the thinking went, patients would be steered toward providers who charge less than emergency rooms, saving money for insurers and, ultimately, for patients and taxpayers. So has it worked? The official statistics on emergency-room visits are published on an annual basis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the most recent report -- released in 2014 -- covers 2011, which was well before most elements of the health care law kicked in. So that data set is not helpful in judging the accuracy of Fiorina\u2019s claim. Failing that, the best data we have comes from a survey conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians in March 2015. The most relevant question in that survey was: \"Since January 1, 2014, when the requirement to have health coverage took effect in the Affordable Care Act, the volume of emergency patients in my emergency department has \u2026 increased greatly? increased slightly? remained the same? decreased slightly? decreased greatly?\" Here\u2019s the breakdown, based on the responses of 2,098 member physicians of the American College of Emergency Physicians: \u00a0 Response Percent of surveyed giving this response Increased greatly 28 percent Increased slightly 47 percent Remained the same 17 percent Decreased slightly 5 percent Decreased greatly 0 percent Not sure 3 percent \u00a0 The finding that only 5 percent of respondents saw any decrease in patients in their emergency room provides some validation for Fiorina\u2019s claim. If this is a valid finding, then the health care law isn\u2019t only failing at one of its main missions, but it\u2019s actually making things quite a bit worse. But Fiorina seems to have garbled her talking point. Fiorina said emergency room visits \"are up over 50 percent\" -- not that a majority of emergency room doctors say they are seeing more patients come for treatment. In reality, the survey does not offer specifics on how many more visits there have been after implementation of the law. And a plurality of respondents suggest that the increases they\u2019ve seen are \"slight,\" which doesn\u2019t sound like a word most people would use to describe a 50-percent increase. Another concern: The American College of Emergency Physicians, as the sponsor of a survey, is not a neutral party in the same way a media pollster is. Also, the survey is what is known as an \"opt-in survey.\" Unlike a poll in which the survey company reaches out to a random selection of the desired population, the emergency physicians\u2019 poll is one in which individual respondents have chosen whether or not to participate. Still, the point Fiorina raises is a concern among health-care policy specialists. The magazine Health Affairs noted in July that between 1992 and 2012 the number of patient visits to hospital emergency rooms has risen 47 percent -- from 91 million to 133 million -- even as the number of facilities serving them fell by 11 percent, from 5,035 to 4,460. Given this, 39 percent of E.R.s report daily overcrowding. Again, though, this data is from before the law fully went into effect. Such figures suggest a problem many years in the making, but there\u2019s also concern that the Affordable Care Act specifically has made the problem worse. One theory is that insurance rates have increased faster than the number of doctors available to serve the newly insured patients. This may have led some newly insured patients to fall back on old habits and make the E.R. their first option even for non-emergency care. Our ruling Fiorina said, \"If you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent.\" Fiorina has raised a legitimate concern about the health care law, but the eye-popping statistic she cites is not supported either by official federal data or by a recent survey of members of the American College of Emergency Physicians."

            "claim": "Says \"my advocacy questioning contracting out in Parks \u2026 delayed and altered the renewal of the Brooks contract, and reduced the number of contracted employees in Parks from over 100 to fewer than 40.\"",
            "evidence": "\nPortland Parks & Recreation has long used a contractor to hire workers for seasonal help as lifeguards, instructors, front desk help and such. Organized labor has protested the use, claiming it is a way for the city to avoid paying benefits. \n\nPortland city commissioner Amanda Fritz, who is up for re-election in May, opposes privatization of city jobs and recently claimed credit for reducing the number of workers on contract at parks.\n\n\"At my urging, Commissioner (Nick) Fish reviewed contracting out in Parks. As a result, the number of contracted employees dropped from over 100 to under 40 in the three years I've been in office,\" she wrote in response to a questionnaire by Occupy Portland.\n\nShe repeated the claim in another primary election questionnaire: \"My advocacy questioning contracting out in Parks, despite not being the Commissioner in Charge of that bureau, delayed and altered the renewal of the Brooks contract, and reduced the number of contracted employees in Parks from over 100 to fewer than 40.\"\n\nThe questions for PolitiFact Oregon are straightforward. Did the number of workers on contract at parks drop? And, more importantly, was Fritz responsible for the reduction?\n\nParks spokesman Mark Ross confirmed that in 2009, the bureau had on average between 60 to 120 workers through S. Brooks and Associates. In February 2009, there were 57 workers. By July 2011, the number was 36.\n\nSo Fritz is correct on the numbers. But was she behind the drop in contracted hires, as she claims? Pinning down this part proved challenging for PolitiFact Oregon.\n\nFritz\u2019s office says yes, and that but for her intervention the numbers would not have declined. However, Parks and Recreation and the city\u2019s Human Resources director both credit a rule that went into effect in January 2008, allowing seasonal city employees to work more hours, thereby reducing the need to hire workers on contract. (A representative for Brooks did not return phone calls or email requesting comment.)\n\n\"The number had started to dramatically decrease in 2008 once we made the charter change and it has continued to decrease as a result of the charter change and as a result of the types of programs and activities that parks is running,\" said HR director Yvonne Deckard.\n\nPreviously seasonal workers could work at most 860 hours in a year. The rule change increased the maximum to 1,200 hours a year. Fritz, we should point out, joined the City Council in January 2009. She had nothing to do with the new hours.\n\nSo, what is Fritz\u2019s office talking about?\n\nWell, in February 2009, the City Council considered renewing the Brooks contract for another five years. This was a sore subject with Laborers\u2019 Local 483, the union that represents many parks workers. Leaders there raised the issue of contract workers with Nick Fish soon after he inherited the bureau in January. Fritz also lobbied Fish to reconsider the contract.\n\n\"I do recall strongly that she had a concern about that contract,\" Fish said. \"She wanted to know more about it. She did in fact meet with me about it. She's the reason it got scaled back.\"\n\nThe City Council eventually agreed to a one-year renewal, not five years. But we still wanted to know how renewing a contract for a shorter period of time reduced the use of Brooks workers.\n\nTim Crail, a spokesman for Fritz, explained that the shortened time period prompted Fish\u2019s office, the parks bureau and labor leaders to \"negotiate moving classifications, which has resulted in a reduced reliance on the Brooks contract to fill certain job classifications. Thus the reduction from 100 to 40,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But for Commissioner Fritz questioning the five year extension on February 25th, 2009, the changes would not have occurred.\"\n\nYet that\u2019s not what happened. Crail didn\u2019t have the number of positions recategorized. The contract and its amendments, which we requested, did not change. And Fish told us that talks between parks and labor didn\u2019t result in a new agreement on when to use contract workers.\n\nFish can\u2019t recall how the parks bureau came to reduce its reliance on Brooks. It may have been a combination of concerted effort and scheduling as allowed under the 1,200-hour rule. (By the way, the maximum is now 1,400 hours a year.)\n\n\"It was both my belief, her belief and, ultimately, the bureau position that we would lessen our reliance on these positions,\" Fish said. \"It\u2019s clear we did not want it used as much.\"\n\nSo, how do we rule on Fritz\u2019s statement?\n\nThe commissioner accurately states that she questioned the use of contract employees at the bureau. It\u2019s also accurate for her to say that from 2009 to 2011, the number of contract employees used by the parks bureau went from 100 to 40. What Fritz has not showed is that but for her questioning, the changes would not have occurred.\n\nAfter all, Fish had concerns about the use of contract workers. Labor had concerns. The terms of the Brooks contract did not change materially after 2009. The city, notably, did not reclassify positions to favor direct hires, as her office claims.\n\nCertainly Fritz\u2019s questioning helped prompt a council-level discussion about an issue dear to the union and troubling to the parks commissioner. But the mechanism to reduce the use of contracted temps was a rule change, which stemmed from a charter change, in effect a year before Fritz took office."

            "claim": "Under the new health care law, the elderly will be denied care when they have \"passed the age limit for treatment.\"",
            "evidence": "Dan Fanelli, a retired airline captain and Republican running against U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who represents the Orlando, Fla., area, has a catchy video on his website related to the health care bill dubbed \"Obamacare.\"Set in a doctor's office with somber orchestral music as the backdrop, a sympathetic doctor rolls up his chair to talk to an elderly white-haired man in a patient's gown. \"I'm sorry. I've tried everything,\" the doctor says.\"But doctor, I've already waited over six months,'' says the patient. \"I can't bear this any longer.\"\"It's not that it's ...,\" the kind doctor hesitates, placing his hand on the patient's shoulder. \"They denied you because you passed the age limit for the treatment.\"The depressed old man's gaze averts downward -- perhaps a hint that he realizes he will die?Will the new health care bill approved by Congress translate to denying treatment to sweet old men like the one featured in the video? Will somber-faced doctors be telling grandpa that he is too old for treatment? We had to check this out. First we contacted Fanelli, who said he\u00a0posted the video on his website in late March. We asked if he could point us to any documentation -- such as a section of the bill, a position paper from an organization -- to support his conclusion about age limits. The simple answer: no.\"You are asking for substantiation. I can't go to a page in the bill but what I can tell you is the country is over $13 trillion in debt. ... The medical program increases the number of recipients substantially. When you increase the number dramatically ... where is the money going to come from? It is obvious it's going to have to be only certain people are going to get certain coverages. ... The commercial is to show what is going on in other countries with socialized medicine. You can't add more services when you don't have enough money to pay the government bills currently, and that's what we've done.\"Fanelli said he has his own family experience to draw his conclusions. \"My aunt lives in France and had been denied for a procedure,\" to get a pacemaker, he said. \"The reason she was denied was because she was too old. Common sense tells me when you increase the number of people covered, and you don't have enough money to go around ... there's eventually going to come to point where we say what can we afford, what we can't afford.\" Ultimately his French aunt was able to get the procedure, according to Fanelli.Fanelli said the video \"is a metaphor for what is used in England where they use age to determine what services people are going to get.\"Our friends at FactCheck.org researched a question about age limits and health care in England in July 2009. The article quoted a nonprofit in England, Age Concern and Help the Aged, that ageism does occur -- for example a doctor refusing to refer an elderly patient to a consultant. But the nonprofit also stated that a national organization was created to improve health care for the elderly and one of its standards was \"rooting out age discrimination.\"Steve Ullmann, professor and director of Programs in Health Sector Management and Policy at the University of Miami, said \"there is some limitation in provisions of care of people based on age in England,\" for certain treatments though \"you can buy them out of pocket outside of the National Health Service.\"Back to health care in the United States. We asked specifically if Fanelli had found an age-limit in the health care bill.\"I have tried to look at that bill and it's a masterful mess,'' said the 54-year-old retired airline captain and Navy reserves retiree. When we asked about whether Fanelli had read about an age cutoff in news articles, he replied: \"I have been at lectures.\" He heard one from a brain surgeon. \"I don't remember the name. I wasn't anticipating getting a phone interview on this.\" We contacted him again the next day to clarify if he had read any news articles about an age limit and he said: \"There are various articles. I can't quote verse, page and date. ... We arrived at the claim because there is not enough money generated in tax revenue to pay for the current expenses for the U.S. government and this is going to be an additional expense.\"Among Fanelli's claimed sources is his wife's dermatologist, Dr. John Meisenheimer of Orlando. He said the doctor saved his wife's life when she had skin cancer. Meisenheimer also is the doctor starring in Fanelli's video.\"Meisenheimer has discussed they are going to be picking and choosing,\" Fanelli said. \"It is generally accepted by medical health professionals there will only be limited amount of money. Most people believe it will be younger people as opposed to older people.\"We called Meisenheimer, a board-certified dermatologist for more than 20 years, to get his explanation of the video.\"The ad is a metaphor for ageism,\" Meisenheimer said. \"This isn't about 'death panels.' Death panels do not exist.\"(PolitiFact agrees with Meisenheimer about death panels.)But the health care bill makes cuts to Medicare, he said, and that will lead to less care for the elderly.\"It can be a very slippery slope. It's not going to happen like in the commercial,'' said Meisenheimer, whose office website states that he accepts Medicare patients. \"Doctors will have to make a decision: where is the best use of money? Do I use it for a 95-year-old who has skin cancer or for somebody younger? ... There is not enough money there in the can for everybody.\" The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Medicare provisions are estimated to result in a net reduction of $428 billion between 2010 and 2019. It also states that the bill supports \"comparative effectiveness research\" to compare the clinical effectiveness of treatments, but that the findings \"may not be construed as mandates, guidelines, or recommendations for payment, coverage, or treatment or used to deny coverage.\" So that seems to say that even if research shows a certain treatment for the elderly isn't effective, that can't be used to create an age limit for that treatment.We also contacted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which oversees Medicare. Spokesman Peter Ashkenaz told us in an e-mail that there are no age limits for treatment under Medicare.\"There are no eligibility changes to Medicare in the new law,\" he wrote.Fanelli said his video hasn't aired on television, though it's on his campaign website and on YouTube. We sent links to Fanelli's video to experts on the health care bill: Ullmann at the University of Miami; Alwyn Cassil, director of public affairs for the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research organization; and Len Nichols, Director for the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University. All three said there is nothing in the bill that would cut off treatment based on an age limit.The video \"has no basis in reality whatsoever,\" Cassil said. \"There is nothing in that bill that I am aware of, or certainly every reporter who has combed every inch of it that mentions anything about 'age limits.' '' So to recap, Fanelli's ad offers a dramatic scene that has no solid facts behind it. He claims it portrays \"Obamacare,\" but he cannot cite any provisions in the health care bill -- other than vague fear of a European system -- that could cause such a tragic scene. He referred us to his wife's dermatologist -- who also happens to be the star of the commercial -- but the dermatologist did not produce any conclusive evidence, either. So the ad has lots of melodrama but no facts. We find the claim Pants on Fire."

            "evidence": "You write your senior thesis on socialism, it's bound to come up if you want to become a Supreme Court Justice.\n\nElena Kagan did. And it has.\n\n\"Now the empty skirts in the media are saying that she doesn't have much of a 'paper trail' that would reveal her views on issues,\" said conservative radio commentator Michael Savage, \"but her senior thesis at Princeton was entitled, 'To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900-1933.' She's a New York City radical, Marxist lawyer through and through.\"\n\nThe question is not whether Kagan wrote the paper. It's available to anyone who's willing to pay the Princeton University Library $54.60 to read it.\n\nThe question is whether the thesis reveals Kagan to be \"a New York City radical, Marxist lawyer through and through.\"\n\nWe paid our $54.60, and read the 153-page senior thesis submitted by Kagan in April 1981. And we can say for sure that nowhere in the paper did Kagan say that she is a socialist. In fact, while Kagan offers strong opinions about various theories of the decline of the socialist party, she does not give her opinions about the party's political ideas.\n\nThe closest we get to an insight into why Kagan selected that topic is in the acknowledgements at the start of the paper, where she wrote, \"Finally, I would like to thank my brother Marc, whose involvement in radical causes led me to explore the history of American radicalism in the hope of clarifying my own political ideas.\"\n\nThe rest of the paper is an examination of why the socialist party never took off. Kagan focused on the socialist party in New York City as a microcosm of the national movement, and sought to answer the central question, \"What caused the strange death of socialism in New York City?\"\n\nAnd, she concludes, \"The socialists' failure to maintain their momentum grew from their failure ever to achieve internal harmony.\"\n\nWe put a call in to Savage's people at World Net Daily to see if there was some other evidence to support the \"Marxist\" claim other than Kagan's college thesis, and we got no reply.\n\nSo we're left with the thesis. Here are the parts of it that have given some people pause (they're from the paper's conclusion):\n\n\"In our times, a coherent socialist movement is nowhere to be found in the United States. Americans are more likely to speak of a golden past than of a golden future, of capitalism's glories than of socialism's greatness. Conformity overrides dissent; the desire to conserve has overwhelmed the urge to alter. Such a state of affairs cries out for explanation. Why, in a society by no means perfect, has a radical party never attained the status of a major political force? Why, in particular, did the socialist movement never become an alternative to the nation's established parties?\"\n\nAnd this is the final paragraph:\n\n\"Through its own internal feuding, then, the (Socialist Party) exhausted itself forever and further reduced labor radicalism in New York to the position of marginality and insignificance from which it has never recovered. The story is a sad but also chastening one for those who, more than a half century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America. Radicals have often succumbed to the devastating bane of sectarianism; it is easier, after all, to fight one's fellows than it is to battle an entrenched and powerful foe. Yet if the history of Local New York shows anything, it is that American radicals cannot afford to become their own worst enemies. In unity lies their only hope.\"\n\nDoes this amount to Kagan showing political leanings toward socialism? Not according to Sean Wilentz, the Princeton history professor who advised Kagan on her senior thesis.\n\n\"She was interested in it,\" Wilentz told the New York Times. \"To study something is not to endorse it.\"\n\nAccording to a May 1, 2010, story on Kagan in the Daily Princetonian, \"Wilentz defended Kagan against her critics, noting that she was adept at removing her personal beliefs from her academic research on labor and radical history.\n\n\"Sympathy for the movement of people who were trying to better their lives isn't something to look down on,\" Wilentz told the Princetonian. \"Studying something doesn't necessarily mean that you endorse it. It means you're into it. That's what historians do.\"\n\nAnd just to be even more clear, Wilentz said, \"Elena Kagan is about the furthest thing from a socialist. Period. And always had been. Period.\"\n\nIndeed, in an interview with the student paper, Steven Bernstein, a classmate who appointed Kagan to the school paper, described her politics as \"progressive and thoughtful but well within the mainstream of the ... sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case.\"\n\nIn her later, professional career, Kagan aligned herself with the Democratic Party. In 1988, she was a staff member on Gov. Mike Dukakis' presidential campaign. She later served as associate counsel to President Bill Clinton, and went on to act as Clinton's deputy assistant for domestic policy. And, of course, she was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as solicitor general last year.\n\nYet there's nothing in her record that suggests she's a Marxist, as Savage claimed. Yes, she wrote a paper about socialism in college. But she never said in the thesis that she subscribed to the political ideas of socialism. In fact, she mostly adopts the dispassionate tone of a historian. And there's certainly nothing in the public record to suggest she has since become one. Writing a history thesis about socialism doesn't amount to endorsing it.\n\nSo once again, we have a political commentator attacking someone as a \"Marxist\" with absolutely no evidence to back it up. That's not just false, it's irresponsibly so. Pants on Fire!"

In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate. At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans. \"I don\u2019t agree with that at all,\" Bullock said. \"That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don\u2019t agree with that statement.\" The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock\u00a0has adopted two\u00a0African-American children -- a boy and a girl. \"I would like my rights represented and those of my son \u2014 very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,\" she says. \"When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.\" We found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton \"if you don\u2019t like our president you can leave and never come back again."

            "evidence": "A long-running online myth mocks how much time and money NASA and Congress allegedly spent to develop a space pen that can write in zero gravity and extreme temperatures because the Russians simply \"used a pencil.\" The post\u00a0reads, \"(When) NASA started sending astronauts into space they quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat this problem Congress approved a program and NASA scientists spent a decade and over $165 million developing a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, on almost any surface and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 Celsius. The Russians used a pencil...Your taxes are due again in April.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the claim makes for a good story, it has been debunked several times over. According to NASA, both U.S. astronauts and Soviet Union cosmonauts used pencils on their first space missions. In fact, NASA ordered 34 mechanical pencils from Houston\u2019s Tycam Engineering Manufacturing, Inc., for Project Gemini, the agency\u2019s second human spaceflight program, which flew in 1965 and 1966. The total cost, however, came to $4,382.50 \u2014 or $128.89 a pencil. Public outcry followed, and NASA began searching for a cheaper option for future flights. (NASA also became especially cautious about allowing onboard flammable objects such as pencils after a fire broke out in 1967 on the Apollo 1 test mission, killing three astronauts.) It was around the same time that Paul C. Fisher and his company, the Fisher Pen Co., designed a ballpoint pen that would operate better in space. The company reportedly invested about $1 million in the effort. But none of those funds came from NASA or Congress, according to multiple sources, including NASA and a spokesperson for Fisher\u2019s company, now called Fisher Space Pen. In 1965, Fisher patented the Space Pen, which used a pressurized ink cartridge and could write upside down, underwater, in other liquids and in extreme temperatures ranging from minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of the earlier controversy, though, NASA reports in its own account that it was \"hesitant in its approach.\" After a series of tests, NASA managers agreed to equip astronauts with Fisher\u2019s anti-gravity ballpoint pen and, in 1967, the space agency purchased approximately 400 pens at $6 per unit. In 1969, the Soviet Union also purchased 100 of Fisher\u2019s pens, and 1,000 ink cartridges, for use in its Soyuz space flights. According to Scientific American, eventually NASA and the Soviet space agency both bought the pens at $2.39 per pen, receiving the same discount for buying \u00a0in bulk. In the 50 years since, both American astronauts and Soviet/Russian cosmonauts have continued to use Fisher\u2019s pens. An old myth that NASA and Congress spent over \"$165 million\" to develop the space pen while the Russians simply used pencils has recently resurfaced on the internet. Initially, both space programs used pencils. Both eventually started to use Fisher\u2019s Space Pen, which was developed and funded with private money, not government money."

            "claim": "\"Bernie Sanders voted in favor of every war during his tenure.\"",
            "evidence": "A shareable image circulating on social media claims that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders \"voted in favor of every war during his tenure\" in Congress. \"Just like the rest.\" Sanders portrays himself as an opponent of open-ended military intervention overseas; his campaign website\u2019s issues page says he will \"follow the American people, who do not want endless war.\"\u00a0 But the post is incorrect about his record. (The Sanders campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Sanders has had a long career in Congress, first serving in the House between 1991 and 2007, and since then in the Senate, representing Vermont. His party affiliation in Congress is as an independent, but he caucuses with Democrats and is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. When we looked at some of the major war-related votes Sanders has taken, we find that he did vote in support of some of them, but he also voted against others. Here\u2019s a rundown: Persian Gulf War, 1991: Sanders voted against authorizing the war.\u00a0 Iraq War, 2002: Sanders voted against authorizing the war. War in Yemen, 2018: Not only did Sanders vote to end U.S. military support for Saudia Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, but Sanders was the lead sponsor of the bill. He managed the unusual feat of securing bipartisan support for the measure during the presidency of Donald Trump. Trump eventually vetoed the resolution and the Senate was unable to override his veto. Bosnia War, 1998. This measure was for removing military forces after they were already there. It failed, but Sanders voted against it. So he voted in favor of staying. He joined most Democrats in voting against it, effectively supporting President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Kosovo War, 1999.\u00a0Sanders voted yes\u00a0on this measure to authorize the war, which failed in the House. Here, too, Sanders joined most Democrats in voting to back the use of force by Clinton. Post-9/11 authorization for the use of military force, 2001: Sanders voted in favor. Only one House member, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., voted against the measure. The post says that Sanders \"voted in favor of every war during his tenure.\" That\u2019s incorrect. Sanders\u2019 record on major war authorization votes is actually mixed. While he cast votes affirming military actions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and after 9/11, Sanders voted against entering the Persian Gulf War in 1991, against entering the Iraq War in 2002, and successfully led the charge to pass a measure that would have removed U.S. support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen in 2018."

            "claim": "\"This race will be the Democrats\u2019 top target this November.\"",
            "evidence": "Angling to win Tuesday's runoff to be the Republican nominee for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court, Debra Lehrmann said in a recent mailer that the GOP must nominate a strong candidate in the general election because \"this race will be the Democrats\u2019 top target in November.\"In a year with numerous statewide offices, including governor, up for grabs, we wondered whether a seat on the state\u2019s highest civil court is really going to top Texas Democrats' priorities.First, a little background: Lehrmann, who has been a judge in Tarrant County for more than 20 years, and Rick Green, a lawyer and former Texas House member from Dripping Springs, were the top vote-getters among six candidates for the court\u2019s Place 3 seat in the March 2 GOP primary. The runoff is happening because neither received more than half the vote.In response to our inquiry, Lehrmann\u2019s campaign spokesman, Craig Murphy, quickly added a big \"if\" to the prediction in Lehrmann's mailer. Murphy said Democrats would zero in on the court race if Green wins the GOP runoff, because that would boost Democratic nominee Jim Sharp's chances of winning the seat.Green \"would definitely be their No. 1 target if he managed to get the nomination,\" Murphy said. Murphy said he's not the only one who thinks so, pointing us to political commentary from three publications: Texas Monthly, the Austin Chronicle and a pro-Democratic blog, the Burnt Orange Report.Two days after the party primaries, Texas Monthly's Paul Burka, a longtime observer of politics, wrote on his blog that \"unexpected developments\" could test his oft-repeated assertion that Democrats, aside from gubernatorial hopeful Bill White, do not have a chance of winning a statewide race this year. (Democrats haven\u2019t won a statewide office since 1994.)Burka said two contests could prove him wrong. He called Railroad Commission nominee Jeff Weems the Democrats\u2019 \"best shot\" and mentioned the Place 3 Supreme Court race as \"another possibility,\" adding that if Green wins the GOP runoff, Sharp, a Houston appellate judge, \"might get a lot of backing from the state\u2019s legal community.\"On April 2, the Austin Chronicle's endorsement of Lehrmann in the runoff noted that \"serious Republicans and their political organizations\" might worry that a Green nomination makes \"a November Democratic victory much more likely.\" Earlier, in a post-primary post, the Burnt Orange Report said that if Green wins the runoff, \"we've got to make sure folks pay close attention to this race now through November.\"Why do Murphy and others consider Green a weak candidate?Murphy said one reason is that Green has been beaten by a Democrat before: In 2002, he lost his Texas House seat to Democratic challenger Patrick Rose. Other critics of Green's candidacy have focused on his lack of judicial experience and several episodes from his past, including the taping of an infomercial in the Capitol and his admitted swing at Rose outside a Hays County polling place in 2006.After the 2001 legislative session, Texas Monthly named Green one of the 10 worst legislators for what the magazine termed \"ethical pratfalls.\"In a YouTube video titled \"Are the accusations true?\" and posted April 4, Green says the ethics issues have been dredged up to sink his candidacy, although he acknowledges hitting Rose and has apologized.We asked Sharp, who did not have a primary opponent, if his judicial race will be his party's top target, whether or not Green is his opponent. \"I can tell you uncategorically that it is not,\" Sharp said.Sharp said the Texas Democratic Party \"will not be persuaded by anything to do anything but what their agenda is, and the agenda is legislative seats\" and the governorship -- an agenda that he said has not changed since at least 2004.Kirsten Gray, a spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, echoed that assessment. \"The Texas Supreme Court races are certainly very important to Texas Democrats,\" she said. \"However, these races are not more important than the governor\u2019s office, taking a majority of seats in the (Texas) House and winning other statewide offices.\"Ed Sills, communications director for the Texas AFL-CIO, said that \"any Democrat would probably say the top target in November is the governor's office.\"One sign of a party's priorities is how much money a candidate attracts. Sharp did not tell us precisely how much money he has raised this year, saying only that the amount is \"still in the four-figure range.\" Meanwhile, Bill White, the Democratic Party's gubernatorial nominee, reported more than $2.2 million in political contributions gathered from Jan. 22 to Feb. 20.Still, the fact that the Democrats are fielding candidates for all three Supreme Court races this year represents an uptick of sorts. In 2006, the last time gubernatorial and Supreme Court candidates were on the same ballot, the Democrats put up only one contender in the five high court races: Bill Moody, a state district judge in El Paso who lost to incumbent Republican Don Willett.In the last 30-day reporting period before the general election that year, Moody spent $23,434 while Chris Bell, the Democratic nominee for governor, reported spending $2.9 million.Where does all this leave Lehrmann's statement?We didn't find anyone who agreed with Lehrmann that the Supreme Court seat would be the Democrats' top fall target -- or any other indicators, such as surging campaign donations. Besides, her campaign's explanation for the statement includes a caveat -- a Green runoff victory -- that was not spelled out in her mailer."

            "claim": "A Denver International Airport mural of people wearing masks was painted in 1994.",
            "evidence": "Conspiracy theories that claim COVID-19 was planned as part of a world domination scheme by the \"elite\" have run amok on the internet. A miscaptioned mural of people wearing masks was recently tacked onto those rumors as more evidence of the plot. But it\u2019s not. In late June 2020, Facebook users shared a photograph of a mural that showed people of the world wearing masks. The posts claim that the mural was created in 1994 for the Denver International Airport, and the mural proves that the virus was planned. \"The Denver airport mural painted in 1994. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\" text along the bottom of the image reads. One user who shared the image wrote: \"And I\u2019m the conspiracy \"theorist\"?! Sorry, but no\u2026\" Another said, \"PLANDEMIC 1994 Denver International airport. Illuminati artworks on display.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0 The mural itself is legitimate. But it\u2019s not from 1994, it\u2019s not in the airport, and it didn\u2019t portend the coronavirus pandemic. There is some confusion over who created the piece, but we can confirm that it has never been displayed in the Denver International Airport and was made in 2020, not 1994. The earliest online appearance of the piece was when CJ Trinidad, an artist in the Philippines, shared it to his Facebook page in February 2020 with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\"\u00a0 He posted multiple photographs of the artwork, including one of it in progress, and another of him posing with it. His signature appears at the bottom right corner of the piece, and apparel that features the artwork has also been shared on his Facebook account. But the same piece was credited to someone named Neha Kumari for a coronavirus-themed global art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Kumari entered it into the competition under a different title. The image of the mural on the website also shows Trinidad\u2019s signature is cut off.\u00a0 Authorship aside, the listed submission date of the artwork on the contest website is where people may have gotten the wrong idea about when it was created. The piece is listed on the site as being submitted on Dec. 28, 1995, but this appears to be an error. The competition\u2019s submissions didn\u2019t open until April 2020. We reached out to the organization for clarification but haven\u2019t heard back. As for the Denver airport piece of the claim, that\u2019s easy to disprove. Alex Renteria, an airport spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the piece is not from the airport\u2019s collection. \"The only mural painted in 1994 for DEN featuring international children wearing traditional clothing and that also features flags is Leo Tanguma\u2019s \u2018Children of the World Dream of Peace,\u2019 but none are wearing masks,\" Renteria said. The airport opened to the public in February 1995 and has been a hotbed for conspiracy theories for decades, particularly involving its bold, and sometimes unnerving, public art pieces. Facebook posts claim that a piece of artwork that shows citizens of the world wearing masks was created in 1994 and is displayed in the Denver International Airport.\u00a0 While the original artist is still unclear, the image of the piece does not show a mural that was made in 1994 at the airport.\u00a0"

            "claim": "On tax inversions, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0\"surprisingly attacked this tax scheme.\"",
            "evidence": "Forget what the fast food combo of Burger King and Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons might mean for the North American diet, consider the hit on American tax collections. Certainly that\u2019s what stuck in the craw of Chris Matthews, host of Hardball on MSNBC. When the dust settles, the new company will be Canadian, a move that would change Burger King\u2019s American tax status. On his show Aug. 27, as Matthews turned to his guests, it was crystal clear what he thought of this deal. \"Your thoughts now on this stinking idea to sneak out of the United States, sell all the hamburgers you can here, and skip your responsibilities to the American people,\" Matthews asked. Matthews said this was all a \"tax avoidance tactic.\"\u00a0And he told his guest his antipathy for it was shared by a most unexpected party, the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. \"The lead editorial today surprisingly attacked this tax scheme,\" Matthews said. That would be interesting if it were accurate. But it isn\u2019t. The newspaper\u2019s target was the American tax code. It said the Burger King deal provides \"a valuable public education on the need to reform America's noncompetitive tax system.\" It praised Canada for lowering corporate taxes, and in case anyone missed the point, the editorial wrapped up with the word \"dumb.\" \"That word also applies to America's corporate tax code, the reigning world champion in punishing investment and discouraging job creation,\" the editorial said. We wonder if the editorial\u2019s headline sent Matthews down the wrong path. It chided President Barack Obama for losing his \"business front man,\" Warren Buffett, who put $3 billion into the acquisition. The Wall Street Journal referred to Buffett helping \"corporate deserters,\" but the goal was to further tweak the president. That is Obama\u2019s term for companies that do what Burger King has done. We reached out to Matthews and his producers and did not hear back. Edward Kleinbard, professor of law at the University of Southern California and former chief of staff for Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation, said contrary to attacking the deal, the Journal was saying, \"Whaddaya expect, when you put such high tax rates on earnest US companies?\" What made Matthews mad goes by the name of a tax inversion. This is when an American firm buys a foreign company and then says it is based in that other country. The American company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign one. While the U.S. operation pays taxes on its profits in America, overseas profits are subject to the tax rates in the new home base. As for where the Wall Street Journal stands on inversions, Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida, said the paper\u2019s view is clear. The Journal \"is not attacking inversions,\" McGill said. \"They are pointing out that inversions, in fact, may be a reasonable, practical answer to solving the ongoing inability of the United States to rationalize its business tax system to catch up with the rest of the world.\" Several advantages Inversions happen because, at least on paper, the U.S. corporate tax rate is higher than in Canada and Europe. The actual rates companies pay will vary, but nominally, the combined federal and provincial tax rate in Canada is about 27 percent, while in the United States, the federal rate alone is 35 percent. For multinational firms based in America, this means that if they brought their overseas profits home, they would see a higher tax bill. McGill said an inversion makes it easier for the new foreign company to move that money around. McGill added that it also becomes easier for the new overseas company to charge royalties and licensing fees to what is now considered an American subsidiary. \"This will reduce U.S. income while increasing the foreign corporation\u2019s income. But that foreign corporation will likely be in a low-tax jurisdiction,\" McGill said. Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, said inversion offers another way to reduce the American tax bill. \"The advantages from a tax perspective are the ability to load the U.S. company with debt that generates interest deductions that reduce its tax on its U.S. operations,\" Avi-Yonah said. We should note that while the nominal U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent, companies with foreign operations rarely pay that much today. The Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, found that in 2010, profitable companies paid about 13 percent in federal taxes. Even without inversions, Kleinbard at the University of Southern California, wrote in a recent article that the fearsome U.S. tax rate is not what it purports to be. There are simply too many ways that multinational American firms can trim their tax bills. \"Effective marginal tax rates and overall effective tax rates reach the level of the U.S. headline rate only when firms studiously ignore the feast of tax planning opportunities laid out before them on the groaning board of corporate tax expenditures,\" Kleinbard wrote. Our ruling Matthews said the Wall Street Journal attacked a \"tax scheme\" known as inversion. We asked many tax experts to interpret the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial and not a single one agreed with Matthews. They said the newspaper was criticizing the U.S. corporate tax code and if anything, it cast the Burger King deal as a sensible response to a dysfunctional tax system."

            "claim": "Says Donald Trump \"doesn't believe in equal pay.\"",
            "evidence": "With just a week before the election, Hillary Clinton reminded Florida voters that Donald Trump has been called out for \"demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women.\" \"But I guess the bottom line is, he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man. And I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like,\" Clinton said in Dade City, one of her three stops in Florida on Nov. 1. \"We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and our grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said,\" Clinton said of Trump. \"He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry.\" That\u2019s a long list. Here, we wanted to know if Trump has taken a position against equal pay. We found that Trump has said various things but at times has said he supports the concept that women and men should make equal pay. Equal pay We\u2019ve detailed key issues about the gender wage gap in our PolitiFact Sheet, but a consistent argument is that women earn 77 cents on the dollar that men earn. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Institute for Policy Women\u2019s Research says discrimination is a big factor for why the gender wage gap still persists. Experts consider \"occupational segregation\" another reason for the wage gap, which means women more often than men work in jobs that pay low and minimum wages. In her campaign website, Clinton says she will work to close the pay gap and to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill she introduced when she was a senator. Trump\u2019s stance Trump\u2019s campaign website does not include specific policies for how he would handle equal pay concerns if he was elected president. But his campaign refuted Clinton\u2019s claim that Trump doesn\u2019t believe in equal pay. \"We support equal pay for equal work and will enforce all statutes against discrimination,\" Trump\u2019s campaign said in a statement. At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, said that at Trump Organization \"women are paid equally for the work that we do.\" She said her father had made wage equality a practice at his company. \"He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him,\" Trump said. But before the convention, in January, the New York Times reported a former female Iowa field organizer filed a discrimination complaint, saying men at Trump\u2019s campaign doing the same jobs were paid more and were permitted to plan and speak at rallies, but her requests were ignored. Trump told the New York Times the former organizer was a disgruntled employee and that his people told him \"she did a terrible job.\" Factcheck.org in June noted Trump has likened equal pay legislation to socialism, and that performance, not gender, should determine compensation. On Nov. 19, 2015, Trump said: \"Here is the problem. If you start getting involved with government on \u2018this one gets this pay and this one gets that pay,\u2019 and then you say \u2014 \u2018Where does it all start?\u2019 Because you could have a woman that\u2019s much better than a man, or you could have a woman that\u2019s not as good as man, if you sort of\u00a0say, \u2018Everybody gets equal pay,\u2019 you get away from the whole American Dream. You get away from capitalism in a sense. \"I can tell you, that I have women, honestly that are just, in many cases, they\u2019re better than men, and I pay them more than men. And to a certain extent, people have to go out there, they have to fight for themselves. \u2026 I don\u2019t know if people agree with me, once you get where everybody gets the same, I mean, you\u2019re into a socialistic society.\" In August 2015, Trump said on MSNBC's Morning Joe\u00a0that if men and women do the same job, they should get the same pay, \"but it's very hard to say what is the same job.\" Clinton\u2019s campaign pointed to another August 2015 interview, in which CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked Trump if he would pass equal pay legislation. Trump said he was looking into it \"very strongly.\" \"One of the problems you have is you get to have an economy where it's no longer free enterprise economy,\" Trump said. Trump said he favored the concept, but that it\u2019s \"very complicated.\" \"I feel strongly -- the concept of it, I love,\" Trump said. \"I just don't want it to be a negative, where everybody ends up making the same pay. That's not our system. You know, the world, everybody comes in to get a job, they make -- people aren't the same.\" Our ruling Clinton said Trump \"doesn't believe in equal pay.\" Trump\u2019s campaign website does not have a stipulated stance on equal pay for men and women, but his campaign says he supports \"equal pay for equal work.\" Trump has said men and women doing the same job should get the same pay, but it\u2019s hard to determine what\u2019s \"the same job,\" and that if everybody gets equal pay, \"you get away from capitalism in a sense.\" Trump has also said pay should be based on performance, not gender -- so he does appear to favor uniform payment if performance is alike. Clinton\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6bff771d-527f-4055-95a6-652087abc7b6"

            "claim": "\"For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97% of the ice sheet thawed.\"",
            "evidence": "Everybody's looking for evidence that pollution, particularly the carbon dioxide released into the air, is (or is not, depending on your point of view) altering Earth's climate. On July 24, U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, whose state stands to face some serious consequences if warmer temperatures cause sea levels to rise and storms to become stronger, was on the floor of the Senate speaking about an event in July 2012 that produced a dramatic change in the massive ice sheet covering Greenland. Because of global warming, \"glaciers continue to retreat. The Greenland ice sheet provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice,\" Schatz said. \"For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed.\" Ninety-seven percent? One way to read that is that only 3 percent of Greenland's ice sheet remained. That would be A LOT of melting, especially for a mass of ice that is, over large stretches, a mile or two thick. Losing that much arctic ice would have a HUGE impact. Not only would sea level rise by roughly 20 feet, the ice would no longer be reflecting sunlight back into space, warming the planet even faster. We contacted Schatz's office, which directed us to two sources. The first was a web page from the National Snow & Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which tracks melting on a daily basis. It says, \"Greenland\u2019s surface melting in 2012 was intense, far in excess of any earlier year in the satellite record since 1979. In July 2012, a very unusual weather event occurred. For a few days, 97% of the entire ice sheet indicated surface melting.\" The estimate comes from satellite measurements. We also found a NASA web page that reported that in July 2012, \"an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet surface had thawed by July 12.\" So the key word in each case is \"surface.\" The melting the satellites tracked was at and near the surface, often to a depth of no more than an inch. The ice sheet itself never thawed, or came close to thawing. Dorothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, whose examination of the event is to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, said unusually warm temperatures that month did produce some unusual melting, but it didn't wipe out most of the ice sheet. \"Sen. Schatz's statement is very misleading,\" she said in an email, noting that her estimate of surface melt is even higher. \"The correct statement would be that approximately 99% of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melt during a two-day period in July of 2012. In fact most of the ice sheet surface re-froze within hours or days of the big melt event.\" Hall said that the last time that much surface ice temporarily melted was about a century ago. \"If that begins to happen more frequently, that is a red flag,\" she said. At the highest elevations, \"the surface will only melt a few centimeters for a few minutes or hours, so none of that liquid water can run off and contribute to sea level rise,\" she said in an interview. The thaw was deeper and more extensive at lower altitudes, producing some ponds and runoff, but even in those cases, much of the water re-froze, although quite a bit made its way to the ocean to contribute to sea level rise. How much of the ice sheet was actually lost? Satellite data show that Greenland lost about 325 billion metric tons of ice that month, enough to raise sea level by nearly a millimeter. That's a lot. Typically, 340 billion metric tons are lost in a full year, according to climate researcher Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. However, the amount of ice lost was only about 0.01 percent of the nearly 3 million billion tons of ice locked in the sheet. When we asked Schatz's office if the senator misspoke, spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa stood by his comment. \"The senator said that 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed . . . which means to become soft, and does not mean vanish. He also specifically said 'for several days in July of 2012,' so that it would be clear that he was not implying that the ice vanished forever. To suggest that the senator said it disappeared is inaccurate.\" Thomas Mote, a geographer at the University of Georgia, says it's a \"common mistake\" to confuse the thawing of the surface ice with the thawing of the ice sheet. \"Certainly we did not lose 97 percent of the ice. Sea levels would quickly go up 20 feet,\" he said. \"We would notice that pretty quickly.\" Our ruling Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said: \"For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed.\" His first sentence is correct. Because he also prefaced his comment by asserting that \"glaciers continue to retreat\" and the ice sheet \"provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice,\" his contention that \u00a0\"97 percent of the ice sheet thawed,\" could easily be misinterpreted as referring to the whole ice sheet.

            "claim": "Says the Florida House of Representatives allocated $24 billion, \"the greatest investment in education in Florida history!\"",
            "evidence": "Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran defended a controversial education bill by saying the Legislature had never spent more on the state\u2019s children. Both educators and lawmakers have criticized the Legislature for approving only a meager increase for K-12 spending in the 2017 legislative session. But as this year\u2019s overtime session wound down, Corcoran touted the overall level of spending the Legislature approved for schools in a May 6, 2017, tweet: Don't believe the hype. The @MyFLHouse sets record spending levels. And $$ goes straight to students, teachers, and principals. #HB7069 pic.twitter.com/rRoxBAAZER That $24 billion is for all education spending that isn\u2019t for colleges and universities, but also includes $419 million in HB 7069. That 278-page bill was negotiated\u00a0behind closed doors in Tallahassee near the end of this year\u2019s budgeting process. It covers everything from virtual learning to testing reforms to teacher bonuses. One of the most contested components is $140 million for the \"schools of hope\" program, largely to attract privately managed charter schools to compete with near-failing schools in poor neighborhoods. Given the heated debate on school funding, we wondered whether the 2017-18 state budget really contained \"the greatest investment in education in Florida history,\" or if there\u2019s more to the balance sheet we should consider. A marginal increase in base funding As a quick overview, the most common measure of education spending is the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP), the main source of dollars for K-12 education. When most people discuss K-12 school funding, this is what they are talking about. By law, it\u2019s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the \"required local effort,\" in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars. For 2017-18, the Legislature increased the base education budget, or FEFP, from about $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion. In the current school year, spending is about $7,196 per pupil. The 2017-18 budget raises that to about $7,221 per student, a 0.34 percent increase. The small change has drawn jeers from educators and parents, and is $200 less than the $7,421 amount Gov. Rick Scott requested in his proposed budget. Corcoran is talking about more than the FEFP to reach his total. Getting to $24 billion His $24 billion figure includes several allocations for multiple programs outside the FEFP, and technically is the total for voluntary pre-kindergarten, as well as other programs including mentoring services and grants. We requested analyses from both the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle, and they came up with roughly the same figures: The entire education budget for the next fiscal year \u2014 including the FEFP, grants, special programs and more \u2014 is about $14.7 billion in state funds (including $3.2 billion from state trust funds), plus another $9 billion from the required local effort. That\u2019s a total of $23.7 billion, give or take a few estimated millions. When you add HB 7069\u2019s $419 million to that, you get about $24 billion. Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said that $24 billion outstripped all education funding from prior years, topping the current fiscal year\u2019s $23.4 billion. He sent us a list of 10 years\u2019 worth of spending, but would not specify what programs his office was counting when they compiled the figures. But that\u2019s okay, because we don\u2019t need to look at every program. Even with its tiny increase for next year, the FEFP is slated to be the highest it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s been on the rise the last few years, after Scott cut education spending when he took office after the 2008 recession. Fiscal year Total K-12 budget Per-pupil spending K-12 enrollment 2007-08 $18.7 billion $7,126 2.63 million 2008-09 $17.9 billion $6,846 2.62 million 2009-10* $18 billion $6,846 2.63 million 2010-11* $18.2 billion $6,897 2.64 million 2011-12 $16.6 billion $6,217 2.67 million 2012-13 $17.2 billion $6,376 2.70 million 2013-14 $18.3 billion $6,769 2.705 million 2014-15 $18.9 billion $6,915 2.74 million 2015-16 $19.7 billion $7,105 2.77 million 2016-17 $20.2 billion $7,196 2.8 million 2017-18 $20.4 billion $7,221 2.83 million Now for the caveats. First of all, one would expect the FEFP to go up a bit each year, because generally the total number of students in Florida schools continues to increase. For 2017-18, the state projects an increase of about 300,000 students. That means despite a small funding increase, many school districts will actually see total allocations drop. Furthermore, Florida\u2019s per-pupil spending lags far behind the national average of about $10,700 (a total that has been dropping in recent years). And even then, the per-pupil amount is less than $100 more than what it was a decade ago, and certainly has not kept up with inflation. Per-pupil spending would have to be roughly $8,358 next fiscal year to simply equal the 2007-08 level, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We also must note that unlike FEFP money, HB 7069\u2019s cash is going to very targeted programs, like scholarships for disabled youth (initiated by former Senate President Andy Gardiner), Best and Brightest scholarships for teachers, and incentives for charter schools. That money also isn\u2019t guaranteed, because Scott has to sign it first. School officials across the state, from Miami-Dade to Polk County and beyond, have called for Scott to veto the bill because they say it doesn\u2019t adequately address their needs. Our ruling Corcoran tweeted that at $24 billion, the House has made \"the greatest investment in education in Florida history!\" In sheer\u00a0dollars, that appears to be the case in large part because the Legislature agreed to an incremental bump in funding. Even if Scott doesn\u2019t sign HB 7069, which targets very specific programs, the main state-local funding source alone is still at the highest total it\u2019s ever been. But it's not a runaway difference. Compared with the current year, the per-pupil increase is less than one-half of 1 percent. The increases that do exist won't affect every school district equally, and\u00a0some counties likely will see less money because of how the state allocates school funds. Corcoran is also including spending\u00a0that hasn't yet been approved by the governor. The claim loses even more luster when taking into account that Florida's education spending, already lower than the national average, hasn\u2019t kept up with inflation for years. The next fiscal year\u00a0is no different. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details."

            "speaker": "Ashley Judd",
            "claim": "\"Pads and tampons (are) still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not.\"",
            "evidence": "Actress Ashley Judd declared herself a nasty woman at the Women\u2019s March in Washington D.C., referring to President Donald Trump\u2019s comment about Hillary Clinton\u00a0during the general election campaign. Reciting a poem from 19-year-old Nina Donovan of Tennessee, Judd said she is nasty as in \"loud, vulgar and proud\" but not as nasty as \"racism, fraud, conflict of interest, homophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance, white privilege.\" \"I am not nasty like the combo of Trump and Pence being served up to me in my voting booths. I'm nasty like the battles my grandmothers fought to get me into that voting booth,\" Judd said. \"Tell me, why are pads and tampons still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not?\" We\u2019re happy to oblige, because Judd\u2019s claim\u00a0isn\u2019t fully accurate. (We tried to reach Judd the day after the march\u00a0but didn't hear\u00a0back; we'll update this item if we do.) When it comes to sales taxes on purchases, states typically set the rules. Seven states currently exempt tampons, menstrual cups and pads from taxation, the latest of which came into effect Jan. 1, 2017 (Illinois), said sales tax consultant Diane Yetter. Washington D.C.\u2019s exemption, passed in December 2016, is pending congressional approval, and Connecticut's will kick in July 1, 2018. Five states (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon) have no sales tax at all. So, as of Jan. 22, 2017, 38 states and D.C. tax feminine hygiene products. Because it is a prescription drug, Viagra, an erectile dysfunction medicine, isn\u2019t taxed in any state except Illinois. \u00a0 Rogaine, a product for hair loss, is exempt from taxes in eight states because it is an over-the-counter treatment and doesn\u2019t require a prescription. (Four states have qualified exemptions for nonprescription that Rogaine does not appear to qualify for.) We won\u2019t weigh in on whether the disparity between taxation of feminine hygiene and erectile dysfunction drugs is ethical or sexist. But there is context for how that disparity came to exist. \u00a0 Nicole Kaeding, a state tax policy analyst at the free-market oriented Tax Foundation, stressed that the term \"tampon tax\" is a misnomer because feminine hygiene products are not subject to a specific tax in any state. \"There is no more a tampon tax than there is a soap tax, shampoo tax, or toilet paper tax,\" Kaeding said. As we mentioned, many states do provide exemptions for necessities like food and medicine. (Kaeding and the Tax Analysts\u2019 David Brunori believe these items should be taxed as well.) But \"menstruation isn\u2019t considered a disease or illness,\" said Yetter. \"Tampons and pads are often included in the category of grooming and hygiene products.\" It\u2019s also important to note that tax exemptions apply to broad categories and not any male product explicitly. \u00a0 \"You could easily pick a drug that only applies to females, say birth control pills, and those would fall under the same sales tax exemptions as Viagra or Rogaine,\" said Kaeding. Our ruling Judd said, \"Pads and tampons (are) still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not.\" Most states do tax tampons and pads, but not Viagra. Judd is off the mark for Rogaine, which is taxed in most states. \u00a0 But it\u2019s important to note that these taxes apply to broad categories and are not specific to tampons or Viagra. Birth control, for example, would also be exempt from taxation in most states because it, like Viagra, is a prescription drug."

            "speaker": "Sherrod Brown",
            "claim": "\"While Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work.\"",
            "evidence": "\nAlthough he didn\u2019t formally announce his candidacy until early this year, within months of taking office as Ohio treasurer in 2011, it was apparent that Republican Josh Mandel was running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nAn ad from the campaign of his opponent, incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, targets his performance in Columbus, making this claim:\n\n\"While Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work.\"\n\nThat made him sound like a no-show employee, which drew the interest of PolitiFact Ohio.\n\nWe asked the Brown campaign to back up the claim. It cited an Associated Press story from Jan. 26, 2012, that reported Mandel was in Washington that day \"to attend a $500-a-plate breakfast fundraiser for his U.S. Senate campaign, continuing his trend of skipping meetings of a board he chairs that handles billions of Ohio's deposits.\"\n\nThat is the State Board of Deposit, which decides which banks get custody of the state's money. Chaired by the treasurer, the panel also includes the auditor and attorney general. It meets monthly.\n\nThe board's minutes show Mandel missed 14 consecutive meetings after taking office before attending his first one on March 19. He was quoted at the time as saying that it was the first meeting in two years involving a major decision about state deposits.\n\nMandel's office noted he is permitted by statute to send a representative in his place when he misses the meetings. Board records show that he sent his chief financial officer and general counsel, Seth Metcalf.\n\nBoth Auditor Dave Yost and Attorney General Mike DeWine also have sent surrogates, the records show. Like Mandel, the meeting March 19 was the first either of them attended personally.\n\nThough sending a designee to meetings is not uncommon, the Associated Press found Mandel \"unique among modern-era treasurers\" by attending none in his first year.\n\nAn AP report from Jan. 25, 2012, said that \"Democrat Kevin Boyce and Republican Jennette Bradley both attended the board\u2019s monthly meetings less than half the time. Democrat Richard Cordray almost always went. Earlier treasurers Ken Blackwell, Joe Deters and Mary Ellen Withrow all attended at least occasionally.\"\n\nThe online magazine Salon published a story on Oct. 3, 2012 -- after the Brown ad was broadcast -- noting that the state treasurer also serves on an additional seven boards or commissions. Mandel sent representatives but did not attend any of their meetings until last March, Salon said, citing information it was provided by the liberal research group American Bridge through open records requests.\n\nMandel's spokesman Seth Unger, who called the report a \"red herring,\" said the treasurer \"has appointed designees to represent him on these boards, commissions and authorities, as has been customary under prior administrations both Democrat and Republican alike.\n\n\"Our designees have also confirmed that the other statewide officers currently on these boards send designees to represent their offices,\" he said. \"It should be noted that while these bodies remain in statute, some meet only very sporadically, and one has not convened for years.\"\n\nThe Brown campaign also provided a list of 225 out-of-office events which could be viewed as political, from late March 2011 to early July 2012 -- 44 of them out-of-state, with all but three of those on workdays, and including at least 64 fundraisers.\n\nDemocrats have pointed to Mandel's calendar before, as an article in The Plain Dealer reported last January, to argue he was barely working or that he was not being forthcoming in how he spends his time.\n\nWhile the events show Mandel's political involvement, however, they do not provide evidence that he failed to perform his duties of office, as spelled out in Chapter 113 of the Ohio Revised Code.\n\nThe treasurer of state is an elected administrator. He does not have specified hours or attendance requirements. It\u2019s not like his office shuts down when he is not there. The treasurer has a staff that handles the daily operations of the office.\n\nWhen the Ohio Democratic Party made a public records request for Mandel's official schedule, the treasurer's officer delivered with it a copy of Mandel's \"2011 Top-Bottom Review,\" listing what he considered his office's top accomplishments.\n\nThe treasurer's Annual Report for fiscal 2012 listed more of what his office called steps \"to cut waste, reduce spending and increase efficiency.\" The week of Sept. 28, 2012, the office touted the launch of a searchable online database of Ohio's state-owned properties and buildings.\n\nWhat does all this say about the claim in Brown's TV ad, that \"while Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work\"?\n\nThe claim in the Brown ad is partially accurate. His campaign cited meetings of the Board of Deposit, on which Mandel sits, including at least one case where Mandel was fundraising in Washington on the day of a meeting. It also cited at least 44 out-of-state political events from March 2011 to July 2012 from Mandel\u2019s schedule -- slightly less than three per month -- and more than 200 out-of-office events, of which at least 64 were fundraisers.\n\nBut the ad leaves out important details needed to put the claim in context.\n\nMembers of the Board of Deposit are permitted to send a representative in their place. Mandel has done that, as did both the auditor and attorney general, who also are on the board.\n\nIn assessing a claim about the state investment pool\u2019s credit rating, PolitiFact Ohio talked to a financial expert from Standard & Poors who noted that Mandel deserved credit for his performance as state treasurer, an administrative post whose responsibilities by law are to safeguard and invest the state\u2019s money. During the time he has been state treasurer, the state\u2019s credit rating for it\u2019s STAR Ohio investment fund has remained at the top level.\n\nIt is not uncommon for politicians to run for higher office while holding an elected seat, and the that can have an impact on the amount of time they are in their current jobs.\n\nBut the implication of the claim in the Brown campaign ad is that Mandel has neglected his duties as state treasurer while he campaigns for Senate. While there is support for the claim that he has been out of the office, we don\u2019t see evidence that the office is not functioning properly.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True."
