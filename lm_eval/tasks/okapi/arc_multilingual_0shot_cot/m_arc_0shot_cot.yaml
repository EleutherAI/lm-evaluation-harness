# this file is kinda stupid, but it's just for grouping metrics, because the original group (arc_multilingual) logs only individual languages
# and we want to log the aggregated metrics in the default group (m_arc)
group: m_arc_0shot_cot
task:
  - arc_multilingual_0shot_cot # very big, 31 languages
aggregate_metric_list:
- metric: exact_match
