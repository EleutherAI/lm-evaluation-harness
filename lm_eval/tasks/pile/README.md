The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00027.pdf

The Pile is a 825 GiB diverse, open source language modelling data set that consists
of 22 smaller, high-quality datasets combined together. To score well on Pile
BPB (bits per byte), a model must be able to understand many disparate domains
including books, github repositories, webpages, chat logs, and medical, physics,
math, computer science, and philosophy papers.
