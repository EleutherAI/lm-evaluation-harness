# Pile-10k

### Paper

Title: `NeelNanda/pile-10k`

Abstract: The first 10K elements of [The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/), useful for debugging models trained on it. See the [HuggingFace page for the full Pile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/the_pile) for more info. Inspired by [stas' great resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stas/openwebtext-10k) doing the same for OpenWebText
