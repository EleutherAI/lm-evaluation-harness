PROST: Physical Reasoning about Objects Through Space and Time
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03634.pdf

NOTE: PROST is limited to the zero-shot setting to adhere to authors' intentions
as discussed in section 7 of the paper: "We hope that the community will use
this dataset in the intended way: in a zero-shot setting to probe models which
have been trained on data not specifically collected to succeed on PROST."
