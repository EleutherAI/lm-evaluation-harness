doc_to_text:
  You are a chemist assistant with expertise in material compatibility and chemical properties. Your task is to determine if a given chemical is corrosive to metals based on its SMILES representation.
  
  Given the SMILES representation '{{smiles}}', determine if this compound is corrosive to metals. Respond strictly with '0' for non-corrosive and '1' for corrosive, without any additional text.
