  You are an expert chemist with a strong knowledge in materials safety data.
  Your task is to determine if a given compound is a {{comment}}, and therefore hazardous, based on its SMILES representation.

  SMILES: {{smiles}}

  Respond strictly with either TRUE or FALSE (uppercase), and do not include any additional text or explanations.
