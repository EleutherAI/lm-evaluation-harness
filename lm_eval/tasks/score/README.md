## Groups

- `score_robustness_mmlu_pro`: two 0-shot robutstness tasks on MMLU-PRO dataset [[1](#mmlu_pro)]

- `score_robustness_agieval`: two 0-shot robutstness tasks on the AGIEVAL datasets [[2](#agi_eval)] multiple choice questions subsets:  `'agieval-sat-math'`, `'agieval-lsat-lr'`, `'agieval-lsat-rc'`, `'agieval-logiqa-en'`, `'agieval-aqua-rat'`, `'agieval-sat-en'`, `'agieval-lsat-ar'`

- `score_robustness_math`: one 0-shot robutstness tasks on Hendryk's MATH dataset [[3](#math)]

## Tasks

Both `score_robustness_mmlu_pro` and `score_robustness_agieval` contain the following 2 tasks:

* Option order robustness:
`score_option_order_robustness_mmlu_pro`,
`score_option_order_robustness_agieval`

* Prompt robustness:
`score_prompt_robustness_mmlu_pro`,
`score_prompt_robustness_agieval`,

Whereas math contains only
* Prompt robustness:
`score_prompt_robustness_math`


### Option order robustness

Measures the model's robustness to the placement of the correct answer in the options list by swapping the correct answer with all the other possible options.

### Prompt robustness

Measures the model's robustness to 10 different prompts. list of the prompts can be found in the `./prompt_templates.json` file under the key `prompt_robustness`.


## Metrics

All robustness tasks calculate 2 metrics: *Accuracy* and *Consistency Rate(CR)* [[4](#cr)].

$CR = \frac{1}{|Q|} \sum_{Q_k \in Q} \sum_{y_i \in Y_k} \sum_{\substack{y_j \in Y_k \\ j \neq i}}\frac{\text{sim}(y_i, y_j)}{\binom{|Y_k|}{2}}$

## Notes

- All tasks are designed for **Instruct** models for which we recommend to pass "`--apply_chat_template`" flag.

## Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [-] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [-] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task? - Will be referenced as soon as the paper is published
  * [ ] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [x] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [x] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [x] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
