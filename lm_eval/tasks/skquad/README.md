### Paper

Title: Slovak Dataset for Multilingual Question Answering
Abstract: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10082887

SK-QuAD is the first QA dataset for the Slovak language. It is manually annotated, so it has no distortion caused by machine translation. The dataset is thematically diverse – it does not overlap with SQuAD – it brings new knowledge. It passed the second round of annotation – each question and the answer were seen by at least two annotators.

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [ ] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [ ] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
