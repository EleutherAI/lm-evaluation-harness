Title: `TYDI QA: A Benchmark for Information-Seeking Question Answering in Typologically Diverse Languages`

Abstract: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05002`

`TyDi QA is a question answering dataset covering 11 typologically diverse languages with 204K question-answer pairs. The languages of TyDi QA are diverse with regard to their typology -- the set of linguistic features that each language expresses -- such that we expect models performing well on this set to generalize across a large number of the languages in the world. It contains language phenomena that would not be found in English-only corpora. To provide a realistic information-seeking task and avoid priming effects, questions are written by people who want to know the answer, but donâ€™t know the answer yet, (unlike SQuAD and its descendents) and the data is collected directly in each language without the use of translation (unlike MLQA and XQuAD).`

### Groups, Tags, and Tasks

#### Groups

* `SelectP`:  Given a list of the passages in the article, return either (a) the index of the passage that answers the question or (b) NULL if no such passage exists.
* `MinSpan`: Given the full text of an article, return one of (a) the start and end byte indices of the minimal span that completely answers the question; (b) YES or NO if the question requires a yes/no answer and we can draw a conclusion from the passage; (c) NULL if it is not possible to produce a minimal answer for this question.
* `Gold Passage Task`:  Given a passage that is guaranteed to contain the answer, predict the single contiguous span of characters that answers the question.

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [x] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [ ] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [x] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [ ] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [ ] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
