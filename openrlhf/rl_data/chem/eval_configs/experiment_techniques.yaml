  System: Identify the lattice system of the provided X-ray diffraction pattern. Choose from: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic. In the provided diffraction patterns, Column A denotes the 2-theta from diffraction and Column B denotes the normalized diffraction intensity. A high intensity suggests a peak.
