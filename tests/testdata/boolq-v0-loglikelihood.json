During the 1970s, scrum penalties for feeding the ball into the legs of the second row, packs moving off the ``mark'' or collapsing the scrum were seen as unattractive.

The number of scrums was reduced with the introduction of the ``handover'' after a team has used a set of six tackles, the differential penalty, one which cannot be kicked at goal was brought in for offences at scrums and referees ceased enforcing some rules regarding feeding the ball into scrum. Aided by this change, it is common for professional teams not to fully contest scrums, according to their choice of tactics.\nQuestion: can you contest a scrum in rugby league\nAnswer:", " yes"], ["Scrum (rugby) -- While the Laws of the Game continue to provide for competitive scrums, a convention exists that some scrum rules are not enforced.
