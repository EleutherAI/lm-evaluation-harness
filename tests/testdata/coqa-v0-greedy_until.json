[["Lin Xiao, 21, a student at Guangdong University, has a big family - her two parents, a younger brother and two younger sisters. Lin took her role as the \"big sister\" seriously. When her first sister was born, Lin took turns with her mom holding the baby late into the night. \"I almost did everything that was supposed to be a parent's job, but I felt proud of myself,\" she said. Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago. But the situation is about to change. A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children. The new policy is expected to help raise the population of China. Recently, China has been facing an aging population and labor shortages because of the low birth rate . The two-child policy may also be the gift for every only child. Researchers found that growing up with a brother or sister can have good influence on one's mental health. \"Brothers and sisters do matter in unique ways. They give kids something that parents don't.\" Laura Walker, a professor from Beijing University, told China Daily. She noted that having a brother or a sister protects teenagers against loneliness, fear and so on. Liu Fang, 20, from Shenzhen University, has a 2-year-younger sister. When her sister disagreed with parents over choosing a college major, she helped her to communicate with parents. \"If necessary, I would always have her back,\" said Liu. \"The best part of having a sister is that you have a partner, friend and supporter throughout your life.\" But children with brothers or sisters also have to learn to understand and look after each other, said Laura.\n\nQ: According to the new policy, how many children are now allowed?\n\nA: two\n\nQ: When was it enacted?\n\nA: October 29\n\nQ: How far back was the original policy?\n\nA: about 40 years ago\n\nQ: How many children were allowed then?\n\nA: one\n\nQ: How old is Lin Xiao?\n\nA: 21\n\nQ: What does she do?\n\nA: She's a student.\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: at Guangdong University\n\nQ: Does she have a large family?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Who does it consist of?\n\nA: her parents, a brother and two sisters\n\nQ: Who's job did she do?\n\nA: her parent's\n\nQ: What problems are caused by the low birth rate?\n\nA: an aging population and labor shortages\n\nQ: What type of influence are siblings on mental health?\n\nA: good\n\nQ: What does Laura Walker do?\n\nA: She's a professor.\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: at Beijing University\n\nQ: What news outlet quoted her?\n\nA: China Daily\n\nQ: What does a sibling provide protection from?\n\nA: loneliness, fear and so on\n\nQ: Who is the 20 year old girl?\n\nA: Liu Fang\n\nQ: Where does she go to school?\n\nA: Shenzhen University\n\nQ: How old is her sibling?\n\nA: two\n\nQ: Is it a girl or boy?\n\nA: a girl\n\nQ: What is the best thing about having a sister?\n\nA:", ["\n"]], ["For millions of years, sharks have been the kings of the oceans, the top of the food chain. But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. \n\nShark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. \n\nThe competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean.

BRUCE AND THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. \n\nThe position towards France of Edward I. made it really more desirable for him that Scotland should be independent and friendly, than half subdued and hostile to his rule. While she was hostile, England, in attacking France, always left an enemy in her rear. But Edward supposed that by clemency to all the Scottish leaders except Wallace, by giving them great appointments and trusting them fully, and by calling them to his Parliament in London, he could combine England and Scotland in affectionate union. He repaired the ruins of war in Scotland; he began to study her laws and customs; he hastily ran up for her a new constitution, and appointed his nephew, John of Brittany, as governor. But he had overlooked two facts: the Scottish clergy, from the highest to the lowest, were irreconcilably opposed to union with England; and the greatest and most warlike of the Scottish nobles, if not patriotic, were fickle and insatiably ambitious. It is hard to reckon how often Robert Bruce had turned his coat, and how often the Bishop of St Andrews had taken the oath to Edward. Both men were in Edward's favour in June 1304, but in that month they made against him a treasonable secret covenant. Through 1305 Bruce prospered in Edward's service, on February 10, 1306, Edward was conferring on him a new favour, little guessing that Bruce, after some negotiation with his old rival, the Red Comyn, had slain him (an uncle of his was also butchered) before the high altar of the Church of the Franciscans in Dumfries.
