We come to work with two habitual \nways of dealing with difficult relationships -- to attack or to withdraw.  We \ntend to avoid addressing differences with our co-workers and especially with \nour supervisors.  Information is not shared, dangers are not discussed, and \nmistakes are ignored.  The individual can become overwhelmingly stressed.  \nThe organiziation suffers loss of respect and trust and risks financial \nloss.

People come together with different \nbackgrounds, perceptions, and preferences.  These different habits of \nattitude and behaviour can be the sources of much confusion and frustration.  \nUsing a unique approach to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) through \nentertaining examples and informative exercises, this program teaches the \nstrengths inherent in the various personality types.
