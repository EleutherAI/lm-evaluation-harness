The home has a large solarium and ballroom, a courtyard with a (now filled in) swimming pool, a basement gym and Jacuzzi.

So far my introductory course to downhill mountain biking at Winter Park Resort\u2019s Trestle Bike Park in Colorado is manageable.\n\nDespite knowing the answers to the preliminary questions, however, my heart is beating out of its chest and my blood pressure feels like one of those strong man carnival games where you pound a puck with a mallet to hit the top bell.\n\nI\u2019m out of breath and we haven\u2019t even left the bike shop yet.\n\nThe full-face helmet, knee and shin guards, gloves, and full-body padding warn me the day is about to get more adventurous \u2026 by a lot.\n\nDespite riding my bike almost daily around NYC and exploring trails around the USA like Idaho\u2019s Route of the Hiawatha trail, downhill mountain biking has always been a fear of mine. It just looks so out of control, with so many possibilities for what could go wrong:\n\nFalling off a mountain, bashing into a tree, tumbling over the handlebars, simply looking like an idiot.\n\nDeep breathing and lots of water help calm me down, and I vow not to let myself back out.\n\nFunny enough, I didn\u2019t sign up for the lesson because I thought I would be the best \u2014 although one can hope; instead, I booked this excursion because I wanted to face a fear. I wanted to use travel for one of its most powerful purposes: growth.\n\nMy previous days in Colorado\u2019s Grand County had been full of Rocky Mountain hiking, high altitude kayaking and dude ranch barbecuing \u2014 all things I loved, and knew I would love when deciding to do them.\n\nDownhill mountain biking was something that could very well bring me to tears, break my bones or just be something I hated. It could also be something I excelled at, made it through with a smile and absolutely loved. We would soon find out.\n\nWorst came to worst, I would leave with some gnarly scars and a great story to tell. See, I like to think positive.\n\nDownhill Biking: Learning The Basics\n\nAfter a chat about safety and how to properly downhill bike, our group of eight, six students and two instructors, Christy and John, spend some time on the bunny hill practicing our strong stance \u2014 standing tall without locked knees, arms wide on the bars with elbows out, body slightly back, and pedals flat on an even plane.\n\nWe also talk about our experience with downhill biking. Let\u2019s just say my title of \u201curban commuter cyclist\u201d wasn\u2019t going to get me any street mountain cred with these folks.\n\nI feel pretty good about my stance, although will every passing moment I feel myself getting farther from the bunny hill and closer to the day\u2019s terrifying adventure.\n\nWhich begins with the lift.\n\nI actually enjoy heights, and thus enjoy chairlifts. While I\u2019ve taken chairlifts skiing, the downhill bike chairlifts alternate bike and human chairs.\n\nTo get my bike on, I follow the chair as it drifts away from me and run my bike up a metal ramp slot until both wheels are secure.\n\nAs I use all my strength \u2014 which I\u2019ll admit isn\u2019t much \u2014 to get the bike into the slot the front wheel awkwardly turns away from where it needs to go. Luckily, John is there to grab the bike and fix it.\n\nShake it off, Jessie.\n\nThe next chairlift picks me up, and I forget fear during the 10-minute flight, views of lodgepole pines, Parry Peak (which looks oddly like a catcher\u2019s mitt), and the Continental Divide captivating my mind.\n\nWhen I get off the lift, I\u2019m standing at 10,500 feet (3,200 meters).\n\nIt\u2019s from this high altitude that I\u2019ll begin downhill biking.\n\nThe Adventure Begins\n\nTrestle Bike Park features over 40 miles (64 kilometers) of mountain bike trails, although there is only one green (beginner) trail. Like skiing, trails are labeled by colors \u2014 green, blue and black, along with special blue blacks and double blacks \u2014 with much of the park\u2019s terrain designated for advanced riders.\n\nThe single-track green trail I\u2019d be embarking on, called Green World, is about 5.5 miles (nine kilometers) long, with plenty of action along the way to satisfy any adrenaline junkie.\n\nJohn leads while Christy pulls up the rear, with students cycling over a downhill wooden rollover \u2014 I have a bit of a panic attack with this \u2014 as well as rough and rolling terrain.\n\nI\u2019m not used to the bumps and rocks, and find myself staring down at the ground as well as at the many pines I don\u2019t want to crash into.\n\nI can\u2019t stress enough how bad this is. When downhill mountain biking you need to look at the path ahead, focusing on where you want the bike to go.\n\nYour bike tends to follow your eyes, so if you\u2019re staring at the scary rocks and cliff ledges you don\u2019t want to interact with you may find yourself doing just that.\n\nWhile the instructors have told us this, it\u2019s much easier said than done. Especially when we get to the trail turns.\n\nWe\u2019re told to look ahead and to gently brake before the turn \u2014 not during or things can get hairy. Braking is possibly one of the most important skills to master for downhill biking.\n\nIt should be gentle with one finger, assuming your bike has good brakes, which it should. Brake too hard with your rear break \u2014 the one on the right (in the US, different for motorcycles) \u2014 and you\u2019ll just damage the bike and the trail.\n\nBrake too hard with your front brake and you\u2019ll likely find yourself flipped over the handlebars when the bike halts to a standstill. It\u2019s truly an art to master.\n\nAnd I do, albeit shakily, and not without yelping like a wounded animal. I\u2019m sweating so much from anxiety I need to remove my sunglasses and pour water on my face.\n\nI\u2019ve skydived, bungee jumped, zip-lined, rock climbed, swam cage-less with hammerheads and gone canyoning without a second thought; but, for some reason, this downhill biking seriously freaks me out.\n\nThere\u2019s something about being in control of your own life using a skill you\u2019re not sure you possess that\u2019s seriously terrifying.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019ve now gone up the chairlift and am in the middle of the woods, on a downhill single-track trail that still has five miles to go. There\u2019s no turning back. I\u2019ve either got to suck it up, believe in myself and get on with it, or ask to be air rescued.\n\nLuckily, I\u2019ve got a little too much pride for the latter.\n\nWhen Being The Worst Is A Good Thing\n\nDespite my worries of being the worst in the group, it\u2019s soon something I really just have to own, especially when John splits us up into two groups \u2014 one of five, and one of one. Me. He\u2019s trying so hard to be nice about the fact I\u2019m 10 times slower than everyone else that I have to laugh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine with being the worst,\u201d I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m glad for the one-on-one practice.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the group is supportive, wishing me luck and telling me I\u2019m doing great. Soon, they\u2019re on their way and I\u2019m left alone with my awesome instructor for the day, Christy.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I was so afraid of being the worst, as it\u2019s actually landed me a private lesson. I already feel more comfortable simply not having other eyes on me.\n\nI\u2019m still a bit shaky, and Christy tells me that I\u2019m doing everything right, technically, but that I need to relax. I\u2019m rigid and fearful, and that alone is what is affecting my performance.\n\nMy confidence in my abilities doesn\u2019t come quickly or easily; however, after mile two, my heart has stopped beating out of my ears and I\u2019m actually having fun.\n\nAnd I\u2019m downhill biking! I\u2019m really doing it.\n\nFinding My Confidence\n\nCertain sections are harder than others, and we go over numerous segments with wide sharp turns, steep declines, huff-inducing inclines and huge rocks that just that morning I never would have believed I could do.\n\nAt one point we reach a particularly precious looking turn that I just can\u2019t bring myself to do \u2014 literally stopping short at the top each time I try \u2014 and end up walking my bike around it, instantly feeling angry at myself for giving up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another one coming up that\u2019s slightly different than that one, so you\u2019ll have a chance to try again,\u201d says Christy.\n\nWhen we get to the second turn, I give myself a head start with pedaling, take a deep breath, utter a \u201cyou can do this\u201d mantra and \u2026 go.\n\nI easily make it around the scary curve unscathed and with a smile.\n\nChristy smirks, \u201cRemember how I said that turn was slightly different? It was steeper and longer. I just didn\u2019t want to freak you out. You did it!\u201d\n\nAfter that my confidence shoots through the roof. I feel invincible, simply because I successfully tackled something I wasn\u2019t quite sure I could master.\n\nThe last leg of the trail introduces me to rollers, essentially a pattern of up and downhill slopes. For this, Christy teaches me how to \u201cpump\u201d the rollers, which means moving your body up and down in tune with the slopes, providing speed and smoothness for the ride. While I wouldn\u2019t say I mastered them, I feel like I got the hang of them to the point where I was proud.\n\nThe trail ends with level mountain trails, until the very end where there\u2019s a long downward slope where I think I might bite the dust. But, I don\u2019t. And I finish in one piece.\n\nI could have easily spent the day at Winter Park Resort riding the alpine slide or doing the maze \u2014 which I do, and are awesome \u2014 but I also wanted an experience that would take me out of my comfort zone and help me grow as a person.\n\nDownhill biking at Trestle Bike Park provided exactly that in an active and fun way, and introduced me to something I wasn\u2019t great at when I started, but feel I could somewhat master with more practice.\n\nLooks like I have a new activity to incorporate into my upcoming travels.\n\nHave you ever tried downhill mountain biking in Colorado?\n\nMy trip was sponsored by Visit Colorado. I was not required to write this post nor was I compensated for it. As always, all opinions are my own, and all writings are based on my personal experiences in the destination.\n\nLogistics: Getting There & Around: Travelers can fly into Denver International Airport. From here, it\u2019s about a two-hour drive to Winter Park Resort. If you just plan on spending time at the resort and exploring their mountain sports and onsite rides and restaurants, there\u2019s no need for a car, especially in winter when their free shuttle takes you around town, as well; however, summer travelers wanting to explore beyond the resort or those wanting to do a longer trip should rent a car. I recommend Home James Transportation for a shuttle service, and Avis for car rentals. For the trip between Denver International Airport and Winter Park Resort the cost was $69. Health: Because Colorado is a high altitude state, make sure to hydrate before and during your trip. Eight glasses is not enough, and altitude sickness can creep up on you without warning. Travel Insurance: I recommend taking out a plan with Allianz Global Assistance.

I added my name on it and thought a bit about it. I even wrote a first version of HNN [2], a neural network library, quite early in my Haskell days. I found that idea to be great but did not see any actual effort around this. So, I'm now thinking again about that and even enlarging it to mathematics & AI. Thus, I would like to have an idea of the number of people interested in being involved in such an effort. There are several tools out there on hackage but they aren't that much uniform and neither play nicely together. I'm pretty convinced this could be improved and as a Mathematics student I'm highly interested in that. If enough people are interested, we could for example set up a mailing list and a trac to organize the effort and then people could just discuss and write Haskell modules when time permits.

Ms. Enders suggested that Ms. Brooks functioned as something of a firewall for Mr. Murdoch \u2014 a buffer against the allegations. \u201cIf she resigns, that\u2019s an admission of culpability,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd part is emotional. \u201cRupert Murdoch adores her \u2014 he\u2019s just very, very attached to her,\u201d said a person who knows them both socially. \u201cTo be frank, the most sensible thing that News Corp. could do would be to dump Rebekah Brooks, but he won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMs. Brooks\u2019s rise has been steady, and quick. She began her career in the Murdoch media stable as a secretary at The News of the World, rising to become editor of the paper just 11 years later. In 2003, she became editor of the tabloid Sun, Britain\u2019s best-selling daily newspaper, before being promoted to her current job two years ago.\n\nFrom early on, she was known for her creative flair in getting articles and her lack of compunction in how she got them. In 1994, she prepared for The News of the World\u2019s interview with James Hewitt, a paramour of Princess Diana, by reserving a hotel suite and hiring a team to \u201ckit it out with secret tape devices in various flowerpots and cupboards,\u201d Piers Morgan, her former boss and now a CNN talk show host, writes in his memoir \u201cThe Insider.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion in her early days, furious that the paper was about to be scooped by The Sunday Times\u2019s serialization of a biography of Prince Charles, Ms. Brooks disguised herself as a Times cleaning woman and hid for two hours in a bathroom, according to Mr. Morgan. When the presses started rolling, she ran over, grabbed a newly printed copy of The Sunday Times, and brought it back to The News of the World \u2014 which proceeded to use the material, verbatim, in its own paper the next day.\n\nSuch tales have passed into tabloid legend, as has Ms. Brooks\u2019s uncanny knack for cultivating the powerful. She was a confidante of Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, at a time when Mr. Murdoch supported the Labour government. She broke the story of Mrs. Blair\u2019s pregnancy during her husband\u2019s premiership. When the political winds changed and Mr. Murdoch decided to back the Conservative Party, many of Ms. Brooks\u2019s Labour friends felt she had betrayed them and stopped socializing with her. Ms. Brooks simply switched friends.\n\nNow, she and her husband, Charlie Brooks, a former horse trainer, are part of a high-powered coterie that includes Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha; Mr. Murdoch\u2019s daughter Elisabeth and her husband, the public relations executive Matthew Freud; and James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s heir apparent, and his wife."], ["| By\n\nOff the microphone of RE\n\nFollow us on Twitter @doomstead666\n\nFriend us on Facebook\n\nAired on the Doomstead Diner on July 22, 2015\n\nVisit the New Diner News Page for Daily Updates from around the Collapse Blogosphere\n\nGet the End of More on Amazon.com\n\nDiscuss this article at the Podcast Table inside the Diner\n\nRecently, we had the opportunity to talk with Norman Pagett, one of the Authors of the End of More, and excellent Primer for people new to the world of Industrial Civilization Collapse and Population Overshoot. Norman resides in Shropshire, England, right at the heart of where the Industrial Revolution began in the early 1700s with the invention of the Steam Engine, and its early application in pumping the water out of Coal Mines.\n\nIn this first part of our discussions with Norman, we go over the early history of the Industrial Revolution and its expansion in the early years.\n\nMuch more to come in future episodes.

In fact two things which expanded London and other cities as well because all of them was the go to transport that's rail transport and the output of sewage, because if you've got a city with a million people in it you've got an awful lot of sewage and you've got to get rid of it, and the only way you can get rid of it was building a sewage system which could only be built with bricks, and the heat needed in vast quantities could only came from coal. So coal firms were about sixty or seventy miles from London where the bricks were fired and they had to be transported into the city by train, and then from that they use the six million bricks to build the London sewage system, which was then pumped out from the London Centre right to the estuary on the North Sea, and then the big engines out there which pumped the sewage into the sea and was just discharged and got rid of . Now again you're talking not just about pumping the water out of the coal mines you're talking about pumping water into the city fresh water in some way and then taking sewage and pumping it out of the city. So those two processes then enable cities to start growing to much larger sizes than they had ever before and so that was a prrocess there that allowed the sytem to take off\u2026\n\nFor the rest, LISTEN TO THE INTERVIEW!!!\n\n"]]
