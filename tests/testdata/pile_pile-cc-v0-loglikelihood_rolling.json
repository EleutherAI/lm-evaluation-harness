[["Friday, March 28, 2014\n\nPro-Nuclear Energy?\n\nDr. Patrick Moore, Co-Founder of Greenpeace and Co-Chairman of CASEnergy Coalition, is among a burgeoning group of environmentalists who support nuclear energy development as a sustainable alternative to other forms of energy.\nThe pro-nuclear environmentalist movement is documented in the recent film, Pandora\u2019s Promise.\nThe Forum on Energy asked Dr. Moore to comment on how nuclear energy advocates and environmental sustainability groups \u2014 two historically opposite camps \u2014 now share common goals.\nForum On Energy: Has your opinion on the green credentials of nuclear energy changed or evolved as a result of recent events in the energy industry, such as the accident at Fukushima, the shale gas boom and advances in the renewable energy industry?\nDr. Patrick Moore: My opinion that nuclear energy is safe, clean and sustainable was formed in the mid-1990s during the reconsideration of energy policy in light of climate change. It is obvious that nuclear energy, when replacing fossil fuel technology, reduces CO2 emissions by more than 95 percent. Ironically I soon became highly skeptical of the possibility of human-caused catastrophic climate change, yet I still believe strongly that nuclear energy will become more desirable and necessary as time passes.My primary reasons for supporting nuclear energy are that it is superior to other technologies as a long-term, cost-effective, safe and clean source of electrical power,and in the future as energy for hydrogen production, desalinization and heating for buildings and greenhouses. As the fossil fuels are diminished, which may take longer than previously thought, nuclear energy will take on a greater role in providing the basis for powering our civilization."], ["People from both countries must return to the simple idea of discussing our problems\u2014and our solutions\u2014openly with each other.\n\nJanuary 17, 2017\n\nReady to fight back?\n\nSign up for Take Action Now and we\u2019ll send you three meaningful actions every Tuesday.\n\nThank you for signing up.

The employer, who owns a gas station, said that Russians live poorly because of low productivity\u2014that is, a US worker has to work 30 minutes to earn enough to buy a bottle of the people\u2019s favorite drink, while it takes 2.5 hours in Russia. This incident did not make the national newspapers or TV, and fortunately, everyone survived.\n\nPeople began talking about such politically motivated incidents in 2014, as soon as the anti-West propaganda campaign began in the mass media in connection with the conflict in eastern Ukraine\u2014there were at least two deaths resulting from drunken brawls between \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201ccosmopolites.\u201d But then these issues were somehow forgotten.\n\nBut facts are facts\u2014many Russian citizens seem to be losing the ability to have a normal discussion about politics, our society, and the world outside Russia, even in our long-standing ironic mode. This is worrying.\n\nIt is worrying that completely literate people, competent in their own spheres, are inundating one another with filth on social media just because they do not agree on specific issues. The issues are varied\u2014raising children, abortions, Crimea, Putin, Trump, prices or housing taxes\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\n\nThe level of ferocity of these exchanges, and the complete absence of political correctness, is off the scale, making you question the mental health of the opponents.\n\nAnother side of the issue is the total absence of any reaction not only on the part of the authorities, but also of people in show business and business in general, to criticism in the media. As Lidia Grafova, a legend of Russian journalism who spent the last 25 years fighting for the rights of migrants to Russia from countries of the former USSR, noted astutely of those in positions of power: \u201cIn response to freedom of speech, they apply freedom of listening,\u201d that is, they do not want to hear anything that journalists and human rights activists have to say.\n\nThis is happening in a country where censorship has been illegal for the last 25 years, where freedom of speech is a constitutional right\u2014the victory of perestroika and the realization of the long-held aspiration of intellectuals and writers, who dreamed of freedom for almost 300 years!\n\nIn the era of the Internet and digital technologies, when essentially nothing can be hidden for long, the misfortune is not only that the authorities don\u2019t want to hear\u2014people don\u2019t want to know the truth. Here\u2019s the most recent episode: the publication on the Internet of lists of people who were part of the mass executions in the Stalin era was met with resistance from ordinary Internet users\u2014they did not want to see the names of executioners or the details of the executions! You would think that nothing would be better to awakening our consciousness, the collective conscience of the nation, than beginning a dialogue about our shared tragic past, in order to avoid mistakes and look calmly at the future. To continue the conversations about our common future not finished in the perestroika years. But no, dialogue was not considered honorable. I think that many of my fellow countrymen have lost the very ability for discussion, surrounded by the ocean of unnecessary and aggressive information, and they are not prepared to bring it back. It is so much easier to find an enemy\u2014Europe, the USA\u2014and to blame our problems on them. Especially since our foreign opponents seem to be waiting just for that. So that they can blame Russia for all their ills. The shadows of the new Cold War have appeared over Russia and the world. That is very dangerous.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nI grew up during the Cold War, and I remember that time very well and I do not want it to come back. Ever. I remember the total surveillance and the limits of what was allowed, the stifling atmosphere of the time\u2014but I also remember how people on both sides of the Iron Curtain sought paths for human and creative interaction, for overcoming the unnecessary ideological confrontation.\n\nAn enormous role in that process was played by academics\u2014historians, literary critics, those who loved and valued Russian and American culture more than passing political interests. In many ways, they were the heralds and messengers of the broad dialogue of Russian and American intellectuals that began during perestroika and involved\u2014for a few years\u2014tens of thousands of the most varied people in our countries: deputies and police, farmers and municipal works, judges and leaders of social organizations, journalists, writers, artists, teachers, schoolchildren and students. This was an incredible time, as a surge of people from both countries rushed to meet one another, over the barriers, toward the future, toward the perfect and happy world.\n\nA school in Moscow that focuses on English, where my son studied, was one of the first to start an exchange program with a school in Seattle\u2014this was an unprecedented experience of friendship and learning for all the children. There were many programs like this in Russia and America in those years, and they helped children from both countries to understand one another, to learn about the multiplicity of environments that exist in our world, and I am certain these initiatives helped them also think about how to make the world better.\n\nI had the good fortune to participate in several joint projects of Russian and American specialists and journalists in the 1990s, as well as in dialogues of women\u2019s initiatives of both countries, and I think that the experience of these dialogues has not been adequately considered. This remains true even though the legacy of these dialogues could help overcome many of the current contradictions we face, including the threat of the coming (or perhaps already present?) new Cold War. It is time to recall it today.\n\nBack then, in the years of the Iron Curtain, things were simpler and more na\u00efve, and the best minds and pens of both countries competed in finding the best arguments, even as they sympathized with their opponents. It was a more honest and open game. And money did not play the most important part. And both sides wanted a true dialogue and real discussion of all the issues.\n\nToday, in the world of \u201cpost-truth,\u201d things are not as obvious. The natural impulse toward dialogue drowns in the waves of information garbage, fed by aggression and neurolinguistic manipulation. It is happening everywhere.\n\nI am ashamed and pained to see how stupid propaganda fills the minds of too many ordinary Russians, how totally normal men and women begin to think that America is the main enemy of our country and their personal prosperity. That attitude did not exist in my childhood despite the conflict in Vietnam and even the war in Afghanistan, where my peers were dying. Soviet people did not have a personal aggressive attitude toward Americans, instead there was interest, sometimes envy, and in the perestroika years, perhaps an overly romanticized perception of the American system of government and business. But there was never actual hostility, as there is today.\n\nReady to Fight Back? Sign Up For Take Action Now\n\nThe interest in personal and professional communication, in dialogue, was the main antidote to relapses of the Cold War for many years. Today that dialogue is disrupted, on both sides. That is the most frightening thing. \u201cOpen World\u201d programs are ended, professional exchanges are reduced, contacts in the humanities and the NGO world are sparse. The sanctions against Russia make any form of dialogue more difficult and threaten everyone trying to find interaction. It hurts me to hear that the American administration is planning new sanctions\u2014whom do they help? Politicians set on aggressive conflict? The military-industrial complex of both countries?\n\nThey certainly won\u2019t bring anything good to the people, merely exacerbating the situation for those who want to continue interacting. This is doubly certain in Russia. Just the fact of cooperating with an American partner will soon become proof of political unreliability, even if it\u2019s about helping sick children or protecting a rare butterfly. The new \u201chybrid information war\u201d is growing on both sides, constricting the space of possible dialogue, and that is a deplorable fact.\n\nIt hurts me to hear from my American friends that the American media are treating Russia like \u201cthe evil empire\u201d that threatens the civilized world, while there is almost no information about the lives of ordinary people and their problems, about the work of public organizations, about how people are trying to improve life and protect their rights\u2014and sometimes manage. Even serious publications sometimes fall back on clich\u00e9s and unexpected parallels\u2014for example, Gersh Kunztman\u2019s commentary in the New York Daily News, comparing the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Ankara to the murder of a Nazi official by a Jewish activist.\n\nThese episodes are probably exceptions, but they stick in my mind and leave a heavy sediment. The virus of aggression, the virus of the new Cold War, spreads like flu, and we must find an antidote.\n\nThe only antidote it seems to me is not at all what US congressmen proposed recently, calling for a new war with \u201cKremlin propaganda\u201d by creating their own counter-propaganda resource. Counter-propaganda, as many years of history tell us, is useless by definition. The only antidote is real dialogue and exchange of opinions, live interaction. Then stereotypes collapse, then come the human intonations that are absent in the mass media and in politics. Journalists and scholars are already talking about this, trying to offer an alternative to growing hostility. A new Russian-American dialogue is more than timely today.\n\nI think we have to try\u2014before it is too late\u2014to return to the simple idea of dialogue and discussion of problems in our common life, which is short for each of us. Dialogue is based on ordinary meetings of people, professionals, peers, and contemporaries. We do not have to agree on everything, but it is important to hear one another. Our interactions are criminally rare, and we don\u2019t know one another at all, despite the apparent abundance of information surrounding us. Let\u2019s try to fix this while there is still time. Let\u2019s try to hear one another. Find new platforms. Revive old ones. We won\u2019t let ourselves be used by politicians and moneybags in the name of their interests instead of our own. Let\u2019s try to insist on the need for real citizen diplomacy. And then, for sure, we will have a chance.\n\nNadezda AzhgikhinaNadezda Azhgihina is a longtime journalist, vice-president of European Federation of Journalists and a member of the Free Word Association.\n\nThe finger-pointing has become a world-wide epidemic. In the United States many liberals who at one time mocked conservatives for their devotion to conspiracy theories such as the takeover of Sharia Law or Agenda 21 are now infected with Putin Derangement Syndrome. They have created in their minds a parallel shadow government in the US whose every function is under the control of Putin. I can't help but think that social media has had a hand in this. Instead of face-to-face dialogue people now surf the web anonymously, saying whatever incendiary thing is on their minds. It's become a festival of feces-slinging.\n\n(0)(0)\n\nRoxannd Fandsays:\n\nJanuary 18, 2017 at 6:23 pm\n\nThe main drive behind the hostility we see today is the old strategy of \"divide and conquer\" by the ruling Oligarchs of the world. Within a country the ruling class may incite the common people to scream at each other, to distract them from how they are exploited and manipulated from above. On the global level today, however, \"the One-World Order\" of multinational oligarchs (as in trade deals like the TPP) conflicts with hawkish military superiority at the nationalistic level. Thus, Trump's appreciation for Putin as a fellow World Oligarch appears unpatriotic to the Homeland Hawks. The United States has a unique role to play in that it has been much more of a melting pot in its history than most other nations, so that learning to get along with fellow citizens is parallel to getting along as a nation with other nations. The most universal principle to unite us is respect for our differences within our country and internationally by what we have in common. That is, the Art of the FAIR Deal is the key, within and across nations, to neither exploiting nor being exploited. First, recognize the source within.\n\n(2)(0)\n\nJeffrey Harrisonsays:\n\nJanuary 17, 2017 at 7:02 pm\n\nI suspect you of being correct.

That got me rummaging through my archives for this post, which is all about how imperceptibly nations can change while we sit around watching tv, having our thoughts, our opinions, and even our morals tooled and reshaped without our even realizing it.\n\nTen years later, do you see it, or do you disagree?\n\nTHE ART OF THE PAINLESS COUPREPOST \u2013 Originally posted in October 2005\n\nin the WSJ that made many people unhappy; some found it defeatist, some found it reminiscent of Jimmy Carter\u2019s \u201cmalaise\u201d speech, some found it downright paranoid and semi-hysterical.\n\nI found it to be none of those things. My impression, as one Long Island Irish Catholic Girl reading another, was that Noonan is on to something, but she\u2019s not quite there with it. Perhaps that is because the next step to \u201cthere\u201d is a step any successful and credible public figure would be very cautious about taking; it is a step toward the Eternal, toward things seen and unseen. To take such a step is to risk reputation and a life-time of work. I don\u2019t blame her for not taking it.\n\nI however, am not a successful and credible public figure, and I have no reputation to risk. Like Groucho, I have no wish to belong to any club that would have me, and so I can dare to walk where Ms. Noonan could not.\n\nNoonan expressed her belief that, subconsciously,\n\nAmericans are wandering through their days with a sense of things being, \u201cOff the tracks and hurtling forward, toward an unknown destination.\u201d\n\nEverything\u2026A sense of unreality in our courts so deep that they think they can seize grandma\u2019s house to build a strip mall; our media institutions imploding\u2026Senators who seem owned by someone, actually owned, by an interest group or a financial entity. Great churches that have lost all sense of mission, and all authority. Do you have confidence in the CIA? The FBI? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\nA sense of unreality\u2026yes\u2026and illusions, too.\n\nSome might argue that what is coming \u201coff the tracks\u201d are the easy illusions of 20th century America:\n\nThe perhaps naive notions that our elected leaders actually seek office to serve the public good. That the press is interested only in presenting the truth, no matter what. That our courts are peopled with lofty higher beings and geniuses who know better than the rest of us. That our churches are both safe havens and by-ways to heaven.\n\nThere was a time in America when all of those statements would have been accepted at face value. In our nation\u2019s babyhood we believed and we trusted all the parent figures \u2013 the governments, the courts, the press, the churches.\n\nNow, past infancy, we have come to look upon those institutions with the glare of adolescent angst. We\u2019ve observed enough to understand that those in authority over us are not the paragons of perfection we\u2019d so looked up to as toddlers. We see them flawed, weak, seducable, wholly human and fallible, and like good adolescents who have caught Mom and Dad lying or stumbling drunk, we at first sneered about it and gave some voice to our sense of betrayal. Now, we\u2019re merely numb. Since our \u201cparents\u201d in these authoritative roles have proven themselves to be mere creatures, and not heroes, well, we\u2019ve turned up the volume on our ipods, buried ourselves in our trendy lambskin coats and shut our doors to them.\n\nOur older siblings are observing this behavior with a measure of satisfaction.\n\nI am not talking about our cousins across the Atlantic. I mean the \u201celites\u201d whom Noonan writes have decided to find their \u201cseparate peace\u201d in all of this. She writes: I suspect that history\u2026will look back and see that many of our elites simply decided to enjoy their lives while they waited for the next chapter of trouble\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re a lobbyist or a senator or a cabinet chief, you\u2019re an editor at a paper or a green-room schmoozer, you\u2019re a doctor or lawyer or Indian chief, and you\u2019re making your life a little fortress. That\u2019s what I think a lot of the elites are up to.\n\nHere is where I think Noonan falls a little short.\n\nThese elites are not simply milling about waiting for \u201cthe next chapter of trouble.\u201d I think in too many cases they \u2014 like troubled eldest siblings, the \u201cfirst children\u201d who have never quite gotten over the subsequent additions to the family \u2014 have been actively fomenting chapter after chapter of trouble, for some 40 years. They are complacently building little fortresses, but they are doing so for a reason. Having written all of these chapters of trouble, they are feeling quite confident that their story is solidly structured, and they are ready for the d\u00e9nouement they have planned. The anticipation of their surprise ending is making them almost giddy.\n\nThe ending, of course, is the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Believing that the rest of us, now disillusioned, are no longer clinging to romantic ideals of honor, or truth or nobility, these always-restless First Children, devoted to deconstruction, believe they are about to take down the presidency, the churches, the \u201cold\u201d government and even the \u201cold\u201d media. They expect to put into place something \u201cbrand new.\u201d But believe me when I tell you what they are building is older than dirt. And up from it. Which is why they will need their fortresses. Castro lives in one, too.\n\nThey\u2019ve been practicing all of this, by the way, perfecting the Art of the Painless Coup so thoroughly that most ordinary folks do not even realize what has occured.\n\nOver the past 40 years these hyperactive First Children have been pulling off small scale coups\n\nwith varying levels of success. They managed to deconstruct the academies, so that education is less a broadening of knowledge than a narrowing of perspective. They have deconstructed the liturgy to insist that a pantomime in clownface is a vast improvement over 2000 year-old sacrament and liturgy. They have deconstructed government by constructing something so huge and unwieldy that nothing coming out of it is reliable or dependable, and almost no one is accountable, either. They have deconstructed the press to the point where the truth of a story is less important than how it may be framed and spun. They have deconstructed the idea of fascism to mean \u201cthose democracies in Israel and America\u201d rather than the freedom-suppressing regimes which surround them.\n\nAnd all the while they have been busily pulling things apart, they have kept the rest of the family distracted with the television, with the radio, with the cinema \u2014 any or all of which have instantly been called into service whenever someone got a little bored and looked around, wondering what these kids were up to. \u201cAbortion?\u201d says Aunt Sally, \u201cAbortion is a terrible thing!\u201d Suddenly every news story is about the grim circumstance of illegal abortion. Suddenly sitcoms are showing the way. \u201cWell, if Maude had an abortion\u2026maybe sometimes it\u2019s a good thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFree love,\u201d sputters Uncle Jim, \u201cit\u2019s immoral! It\u2019s damaging to the family!\u201d Suddenly every film hero or heroine is having free, uncomplicated, undamaging sex, and flashing some gratuitous T and A at Uncle Jim in the process. \u201cI dunno,\u201d he smiles to Aunt Sally as he settles back, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s not all that bad\u2026\u201d\n\nExcept that Aunt Sally, having been spoon-fed her enlightenment by media\n\noverrun with these busy First Children and their co-horts, is not around to hear him. She has taken off her bra, taken the pill and several dozen lovers, she has \u201cfound herself,\u201d lost her children and moved in with her newest partner, Charlene. They own cats and attend drum circles. They protest whenever possible, because a good protest can validate almost any life-choice by pinpointing and naming an enemy, and declaring that enemy an oppressor and a villain, even if that villain is liberating men, women and children and trying to create a safer world. \u201cAn illusion!\u201d They shout. \u201cThere is no liberation, there is no safer world, there is no nobility, no honor, no truth! All lies!\u201d\n\nI will spare you the part where they strip down to their birthday suits and dance around, their sagging, pendulous breasts swaying out of sync with the drums.\n\nPART II\n\nThe First Children applaud Aunt Sally.\n\nThey love the distraction she causes as they work feverishly on their coup.\n\nI think Ms. Noonan\u2019s sense of things being \u201coff-kilter,\u201d is her own gut understanding that the painless coup is near, and perhaps she is not quite sure what might be done to prevent it.\n\nWell, one way to prevent the coup is to be utterly fearless and authentic\n\nin pronouncing the things we believe. Pope John Paul II (and Pope Benedict XVI) made enormous headway against the Painless Coup, which had gone so far as to turn our beautiful churches into bare concrete monstrosities (ready-made for quick-conversion into temples to secular reason) and he managed to reclaim the liturgy and renew appreciation for the Eucharist by repeating the truth over and over, with the reminder, \u201cdo not be afraid!\u201d\n\nThus so, we must repeat, over and over, that while illusions may well be all around us, some amorphous notions, like honor and freedom and truth, are still real. They are not just real, they are Eternal.\n\nWe must repeat again and again that imperfect as America may be\n\nthis is still the land to which \u2014 in large or small ways \u2014 every free nation owes its current liberty. This is the nation that has routinely sent its idealistic young men off to foreign lands \u2014 to die there \u2014 not for empire, not for real-estate, but for the protection and advancement of that unseen thing that is freedom, the strengthener of the human spirit, the burnisher of human potential. First Children and their motley co-horts aside, this is still the nation to which millions of creative or industrious people wish to come, it is the nation to which the oppressed call out for rescue and relief.\n\nWe must repeat, over and over, that the American Presidency\n\nis, like a papacy or a monarchy, larger than the person who occupies the office, and that it can be noble. The American President freed slaves when too many would not entertain the notion. The American President has carried the big stick used to overthrow tyrants and bullies both foreign and domestic. The American President has put his airmen to use to keep his vanquished enemies in Berlin from starving in a brutal winter, he has used his navy to bring aid after tsunami. The American President has dreamed great space voyages into reality, has opened closed markets, has encouraged a people to tear down walls. The American President has envisioned tens of millions of people raising purple fingertips to the sky, and made it so.\n\nWe must repeat, over and over,\n\nthat Liberty is the means by which we created creatures are meant to live and to grow and be. That Liberty lives in the Truth. That Liberty lives where people can speak freely, without fear of injury or reprisals. That Liberty lives only when the press is free and unencumbered \u2014 when it is detached from events instead of entwined in them. That Liberty lives when people refuse to be intimidated into silence or acquiescence, whether in the workplace or within the community. That Liberty is the fragile thing that diminishes whenever one refuses to acclaim it for oneself.\n\nIn between all of those repetitions, we must do something else, if we are to stave off the Painless Coup. We are going to have to turn away from our distractions \u2014 the television, the radio, the magazines, the talkshows, the films, the fashions, the escapist entertainment, even the internet. We will have to turn away from these empty things \u2014 to make them smaller in our lives, where they and the popular culture now loom so large \u2014 and we are going to have to get quiet.\n\nA good musician knows that music is not created only by playing notes,\n\nbut by understanding the spaces between the notes, and their value. Just so, it will not be enough to simply repeat what is true \u2014 if that is all we do, it will only add to the din \u2014 there must also be silence, in which to do our other, more powerful work.\n\nIt is a cacophony of noise that fuels so many illusions, and allows those \u201cchapters of trouble\u201d to be so deftly written. The over-stimulation of our senses has severely dulled our internal sensors. We have lost our bearings and our boundaries so profoundly that we are no longer guarded, interiorly, against scam-artists and tricksters.\n\nWe have to get those bearings back \u2014 to find our centers and get back in touch with our \u201cgut instincts,\u201d which are there for a reason. And the way to get back to the center \u2014 to our center, our \u201cgut\u201d \u2014 is through prayer and meditation and contemplation. Prayer has power. No force can stand against it. Not even the force of a generation bearing down and driving hard against everything that came before itself.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIt is true that there are many illusions in the world. And on the world stage there stride some masters of the sleight-of-hand and the misdirection \u2014 you can recognize them because they are all of a mind, and of a piece, and they are all working different parts of the same trick.\n\nBut if you can recognize a trick for what it is, you can prevail against it.\n\nAnd this is where the Eternal comes in \u2014 the things seen and unseen, which I mentioned earlier. An illusionist, no matter how masterful, is still peddling an illusion. He has nothing behind him but his crossed fingers. Prayer is no illusion, and one needn\u2019t be a master to tap into its tremendous force. Even a novice may use it, although one does get stronger with practice and growth comes, for prayer is never stagnant.\n\nAunt Sally has no idea how disposable she is, or how her raised consciousness has been a mere means to an end, another illusion. In the coming denouement, she and Charlene and poor old, befuddled Uncle Jim will be equally expendable, or useful only for keeping the foodlines and the medical lines straight. They will all be outside the \u201cfortresses\u201d of the elites, with the rest of us, if the Coup is permitted, if the First Children achieve their goal.\n\nSo, it is time for the rest of us to turn off the ipods, shed the lambskin coat and come out of our self-imposed exile, ready to do battle.

We have to have different service levels for that.\n\nAnalysis showed that we just weren\u2019t set to work quite ready for that. We had a maturity study done and we had about a 1.2 level maturity against a maximum of 5. It also revealed that we need to move somewhere around a 3.2, 3.3 maturity level in order to provide the kind of services that would be required to make our organization successful. That gap represented the tools, skills, policies, standards, procedures that are necessary to deliver high levels of service.\n\nOur goal was to create stability: stability in our systems, stability in our service, stability in our satisfaction levels. That\u2019s four Ss and that\u2019s how we coined the term Project S.\n\nIs the maturity level you mentioned CMM or is there something other that you measured that with?\n\nIBM has a customized version of ITIL. They have a service level maturity or service maturity index.\n\nHow rigorous and involved was it to get that number back to tell you where you stood?\n\nIt was pretty rigorous. It was about a two-month-long analysis.\n\nYou got some help from Compuware in putting this together. What did you find you were lacking in terms of knowledge and abilities? Were there any new things that they insisted you bring to the table that you didn\u2019t already have in your shop?\n\nThat\u2019s a great question. One thing we lacked was a repeatable process. That\u2019s where adopting ITIL came to bear.\n\nAnother we lacked was skills in the right areas. We had plenty of skills, but not necessarily the presence of the right skills for the right job.\n\nWe were also lacking tools. Tools essentially mean that we weren\u2019t in a position to automate ourselves so that we could provide higher levels of service. As you well know, you can\u2019t do everything in a manual fashion and be efficient and effective.\n\nThose will be the areas that pretty quickly emerged, and that\u2019s what led us to an analysis of what our toolkit should be.\n\nWe believe in the idea of integration. Integration is something that is quite absent in many IT organizations. We tend to be the worse, we\u2019re much worse than our customers when it comes to buying one-off tools for every problem. What we try to do is buy an integrated toolkit that helps us run the business of IT.\n\nThat, in fact, was our mantra. We wanted to manage IT like a business, and therefore put in the business systems required. A good example is that we wanted to mimic our financial department, financial and HR. We have one product that manages finance and HR, and that\u2019s Lawson. It has materials management, and then it has payroll, it has financial reporting, accounting, general ledger \u2014 you get the drift. It\u2019s a well-integrated product which redoubles its ability to produce efficiency than if you had individual products for each of those foci.\n\nThat was really important to us. The system lets us embed the knowledge of experts and the systems, therefore driving a repeatable process. I said a mouthful there, covered a lot of territory, but I hope you get some sense out of that.\n\nI don\u2019t want to ask you what it cost, but how much of an effort and investment was it to move from where you were to where you are?\n\nIt\u2019s probably the biggest thing this IT organization has approached since its inception.\n\nHow did you get the support to undertake such a project in these times?\n\nIt was simply outlining the gaps between customer expectations and our ability to deliver and matching a solution to those gaps. The organization wanted those gaps filled enough that the sale was much easier.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of interesting. I had to highlight my failures, [laughs] which really is a risky and uncomfortable approach, but in fact, it is the right thing to do. I had to highlight the fact that I had a 30% drop call rate at the help desk. I had to highlight the fact that nine out of 10 problems that we encounter are called in to us by our customers rather than us notifying the customers of the existence of the problem. In other words, they find it before we do.\n\nSo you begin outlining all these things, and then you start talking about what\u2019s coming in the future, and you\u2019re going to have doctors who are going to need the services of that help desk with that low performance. You\u2019re going to have doctors who don\u2019t want to have their systems to fail when they\u2019re in the middle of a surgery. You\u2019re going to have nurses that can\u2019t administer medications to patients in pain if the barcoded med system is down.\n\nWe were able to use kind of Walt Disney\u2019s \u201cimagineering\u201d approach, just tell a story about how things are and how much better things could be.\n\nROI was not as necessary when you looked at it that way, because when you really looked at it, the case we were making was a case of staying in business. [laughs]\n\nOverall, is the end result that you have restructured the department and changed the staffing mix and staffing levels?\n\nYes. We\u2019ve done two substantial re-orgs through this process, continued to evaluate our staffing plans, and brought on a chief technology officer. We made some major staffing changes, major training changes. Our organizational processes don\u2019t even resemble what they used to be.\n\nIf you\u2019re talking to your CIO peers, what would you tell them is the key to know that you need to have this done and the thoughts to entertain before they start?\n\nI think, you know, customer\u2019s king. The key is to evaluate the customer\u2019s level of satisfaction with services being provided. You can\u2019t do that without getting very involved and face to face with the customers. So that\u2019s number one.\n\nAlso, the study of where your organization is going is vital. You\u2019ve got to forecast what are the strategic demands coming into your organization, and what are your current abilities to support the future.\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve said quite often in team meetings is we have to future-proof IT. We\u2019re not future-proofing it against outside attack; we\u2019re future-proofing it against internal demand. The whole idea is to create an IT organization that is not a constraint to business decisions.\n\nDid the evaluation find that the IT department was underfunded?\n\nOh, yeah. There were some adjustments made there also. Probably another way to look at it is funding is not in the right places. It was not just underfunded, but the distribution of money and funds \u2014 are we spending our money on the most important services and problems?\n\nHow much larger did your operational percentage of total budget need to be to meet these standards that were laid out in the evaluation?\n\nLet\u2019s see \u2026 what was that percentage increase? I don\u2019t want to guess at it. Suffice it to say that it went up modestly. [laughs]\n\nAnd you had that commitment going in, knowing that there were things to be accomplished that might cost money, that the folks writing the check would say, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll buy those recommendations and fund them?\u201d\n\nRight. You have to prepare an organization to accept that. Obviously, marketing the project as goals and describing what it takes to meet those goals helps prepare an organization for an additional cost.\n\nI believe we really did an excellent job on not making those costs burdensome. If you really look at our budget, we have stayed at just about the same expense percent revenue. It has gone up slightly, but not enough to sound alarms. [laughs]\n\nWhat are you doing to establish relationships with your physicians?\n\nOne of the things we\u2019d done is strengthen our governance process. We have a group of physicians that are integral to our governance and decision making to represent physician needs. We\u2019re also looking for better support models for docs. We know service levels required for docs are far different than anybody else in the organization. They don\u2019t have five minutes to hang on on the phone.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for easier ways for them to communicate to us that there is an issue. They might want to simply let us know one of the keys is sticking on a keyboard. You\u2019ll never hear about that from them because they\u2019re far too busy to stop and tell you if you don\u2019t make it easy for them to do that. They\u2019re not going to pick up a phone because they don\u2019t like being put on hold.\n\nAll those things we\u2019re doing from a clinical perspective. We continue to enhance their portal. We make that their one windowpane to clinical information, or one pane of glass to clinical information is what I\u2019m trying to say. We continue to enhance the speed, we set service level agreements for response time on the full transactions that represent 80% of their work. We are spending a lot of time right now prepping up for computerized physician order entry. That\u2019s going to be a big one for them. Those are the big things.\n\nIn summary, the two most important things if you were to ask a doc is that the systems fail a whole lot less, and they run a whole lot faster.\n\nAre you doing anything specific to stimulus funding?\n\nYeah. CPOE is going to be part of the \u201cmeaningful use\u201d definition. We\u2019re working with our physicians not only in the hospital, but with community docs that are affiliated with our hospital, and even extending our reach to all the counties that we serve, and collaborating with other hospitals and their physicians to start talking about health information exchange and how we can better share information, and how we can help them achieve the maximum stimulus dollars available.\n\nWhat kind of things are you doing with the physician practice EMRs and practice management systems? How are you tooling up to get them prepared and to get your integration strategy with the doctors going?\n\nBoy, I tell you, it\u2019s essential to have a meeting before we talk about that. [laughs] It\u2019s probably one of the more interesting things I get to spend my time on.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s our strategy in a nutshell: we are going to standardize on one system, one physician EMR that we will recommend, and we will pre-build any necessary interfaces back to our hospital systems. Therefore, if a doc agrees to select that system, and of course we can\u2019t make them do it, but if they agree to select that system they know that they automatically are going to be joined in the information sharing with the hospital.\n\nThis is also where HIE comes. We are looking for our own kind of mini-HIE for docs that might not agree to purchase that particular system, and at least provide some way for them to participate in information sharing with the hospitals that they have admitting privileges to.\n\nWe\u2019re differentiating very clearly between docs that we employ and docs that we have affiliations with, and trying to provide those two levels of service. We\u2019re really trying to work out the kinks on what is going to be our support model. Are we going to be the ASP, or is there going to be a vendor ASP involved? Might there be a hybrid model? There\u2019s still a lot of unanswered questions, but we are right in the middle of trying to sort all of that out right now.\n\nWhat would your credibility have been before you did Project S as opposed to now?\n\nThey would have run me out of town for real. Don\u2019t you write that. [laughs] They would not have even considered it because our service levels were so abysmal that there was no confidence. There was a crisis of confidence in our physician staff with IT. Rightfully so.\n\nWhat had happened was the needs of the organization had grown faster than the IT of the organization\u2019s abilities to support those needs. That\u2019s not unusual. That is the reason you have these clearly defined and measurable maturity levels for IT organizations, because you have to match up your IT organization\u2019s capabilities with your internal customer\u2019s demands.\n\nLast question. If you look back at the last couple of years, what are the smartest things you\u2019ve done as CIO?\n\nWhat a great question. Smartest thing I\u2019ve done as CIO \u2026 probably dealing with IS as an internal business. Allowing that perception to govern how I make decisions helps me make the right decisions. That would be one.\n\nAnother one would be taking no prisoners when it comes to hiring the best. I\u2019ve got to have a team of people who better and more ideas than I do. I want to be the idea vetter, not the idea creator. Surrounding myself with good people \u2014 it takes a while to finally get that figured out, but if you do that right, the rest of the job gets easier.\n\nIn terms of information systems, specific or technical things that I\u2019m proud of \u2014 I kind of don\u2019t know how to say this, because I don\u2019t know how to say this and make it print right, but I\u2019ve spent time with a particular vendor and greatly influenced their product direction. We use a product here, a bed management system that a particular vendor and I drew on the back of a napkin, and he turned it into a product. So I\u2019m pretty proud of that. I didn\u2019t get a doggone thing out of it, but I\u2019ve got a doggone good system.\n\nMaybe another way to put it is I\u2019ve always worked very hard to match a technology to a problem, and not just push technology.\n\nI\u2019ve got to share this one, too: putting in strong governance. If you want to succeed, have strong IT governance.\n\nI always liked somebody who\u2019s got a really firm vision on what needs to change without getting so wrapped up in the minutiae like hospital folks so often do, so it\u2019s refreshing to have somebody with a plan who actually made it work, especially when you get into stuff like infrastructure and staffing and IT governance, which is usually kind the Vietnam of CIOs. [laughs] You get wrapped up in all the stuff you really can\u2019t get closure on.\n\nThat\u2019s so true. I tell you, my boss and I had a long conversation. He said, \u201cAvery, what you\u2019re very good at is the visioning part of being a CIO,\u201d and he said, \u201cI really like that about you, and what you\u2019ve got to do is make sure that you have a structure around you and manage the details.\u201d Because what happens to a lot of CIOs is they get pulled down into details and never get up the 30,000 feet to see what\u2019s going on.\n\nIs that inherent in their background, though, when you\u2019ve got a lot of folks who worked to move their way up through IT, which is the argument of \u201care you better off with someone who\u2019s risen through the IT ranks\u201d, or better off to get a visionary who just lets other people worry about the nuts and the bolts?\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting debate. I\u2019ll just tell you about me: I came up through the technical ranks. I hold an MBA, but more importantly, I have an affinity to business. When people ask me about me and my job, I tell them I\u2019m a business person who just happens to know IT.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that I could run any of the departments in this hospital. A good example is that nobody is surprised when the CFO runs the pharmacy department, or the CFO runs materials management. It should be no big surprise either that the CIO can do the same, or does the same. A very good friend of mine in another hospital \u2014 he\u2019s the CIO there \u2014 runs the pharmacy down there. Another friend of mine who\u2019s a CIO runs the home care division.\n\nSo a chief information officer is not a propeller-head. A good one is a business person. You think like a business person, and you recognize the importance of your specific trained professional discipline, which is IT, but you don\u2019t let it rule you.\n\nI think there are advantages to having a technical background because it does help you understand when your people are talking to you. I\u2019ve seen the other side of the thing where the person did not come up through the technical ranks. It must be horrifying to be a person who has a strong grasp of the business but has no clue about technology, because the language we IT professionals talk on can be scary.\n\nThat\u2019s why, frankly, a lot of CEOs are uncomfortable with IT reporting directly to them. If you\u2019re not the kind of CIO who\u2019s a business person, your CEO is not going to take to you. CEOs don\u2019t want to hear about the bits and bytes and stuff.\n\nI\u2019m going to share this with you real quick. One of my crusades is to make my organization think about what we do from the customer perspective. Don\u2019t tell me that the systems are up 99% of the time. Tell me how many hours you were down, because that\u2019s how the customer looks at it. Don\u2019t tell me that the server 214 is down. Tell me how many patients are getting backed up in the ED. Tell me how many fewer registrations I\u2019m going to do per day because of this. Tell me what my impact\u2019s going to be to the bottom line.\n\nPart of our monitoring effort here is to cause our monitor to tell us what\u2019s happening in the business based on what\u2019s happening in IS. You\u2019re not seeing a whole lot of IT leaders thinking that way, and that\u2019s a problem.\n\nI really want to pick up my phone and say, \u201cYou can probably expect a two or three percent decrease in collections today because we have some stress on one of the segments on the network that prevented as many bills going out.\u201d That\u2019s a different phone call than if I called my CFO and said to him, \u201cJust wanted to let you know that your people are going to be a little frustrated because systems are running slow today.\u201d\n\nSo I think that is really what IT leaders have got to strive for, the user viewpoint, the user view of the services that IT provides.\n\nHIStalk Featured Sponsors\n\nCurrently there are \"7 comments\" on this Article:\n\nI think this is great that a CIO and a healthcare organization recognizes the value of performance for an EMR. I mean think about it, we can\u2019t just expect that buying an EMR, using stimulus money, will automatically cause clinicians to use it. We have to make sure it performs to their satisfaction \u2014 only then will we get the clinician adoption we have wanted for the last 20 years. Way to go Avery!\n\nHow refreshing \u2013 someone who realizes that all of his technology is really just a means to an end, in this case care of the patient. This is no place for egos \u2013 we\u2019re here to serve the needs of others. Sit behind a keyboard too long and that message gets lost. Kudos for keeping your eyes on the prize. With that kind of approach, you may yet end up running the whole hospital someday.\n\nYou\u2019re talking to your CIO peers, what would you tell them is the key to know that you need to have this done and the thoughts to entertain before they start? \u201cI think, you know, customer\u2019s king.\u201d\n\nThe fact that this advice seems to garner constant repetition among HIT leadership circles, especially when the \u201ccustomers\u201d are those with patient care obligations and responsibilities, should be a cause of deep reflection and introspection among those in HIT.\n\nYou said:\n\u201cI really want to pick up my phone and say, \u201cYou can probably expect a two or three percent decrease in collections today because we have some stress on one of the segments on the network that prevented as many bills going out.\u201d That\u2019s a different phone call than if I called my CFO and said to him, \u201cJust wanted to let you know that your people are going to be a little frustrated because systems are running slow today.\u201d\n\nIf the network is stressed, what about calling and having to say that patients died because the right patient did not get the right treatment at the right time? Who cares about collections?\n\n\u2018You\u2019re going to have doctors who don\u2019t want to have their systems to fail when they\u2019re in the middle of a surgery.

Journalists serve a vital role in a democracy and are sometimes viewed (at least in the United States) as the \u201cfourth branch\u201d of the checks and balances system of government. Stifling speech and placing limits on the press is like dulling the teeth of a sprocket on a bicycle. Slowly things start to go wrong. The chain starts to slip and change gears unexpectedly. The bike begins to lose control. As the teeth become more dull, they lose all grip on the chain whatsoever, and it falls off completely. The bike is now out of control and cannot be pedaled.\n\nSince the Edward Snowden scandal erupted, some journalists have come under fire. Glenn Greenwald, the journalist for the Guardian who met with Edward Snowden and broke the initial NSA Surveillance stories, has come under particular heat and scrutiny from both the UK and United States governments. The Former Chief of the NSA has suggested Greenwald be labeled a \u201cco-conspirator\u201d and Congressman Peter King (R-NY) has openly claimed that Greenwald should be prosecuted.\n\nThis backlash did not deter Greenwald, who has continued to report on the atrocities that the NSA has subjected the unknowingly American people to.\n\nThe UK government, however, seems to have retaliated further, by detaining Greenwald\u2019s partner (David Miranda).\n\nDavid Miranda was held for nine hours under the UK\u2019s controversial Terrorism Act. He was returning from Berlin, where the Guardian had paid for him to travel to both give and receive documents from Laura Poitras, who has been working with the paper and Greenwald on their continuing series of stories based on the leaks from Edward Snowden. Miranda was not allowed a lawyer during the time he was being held. Police confiscated his laptop and other electronic equipment, including the thumb drive with the documents from Poitras.\n\nMiranda was detained under a controversial provision of Britain\u2019s Terrorism Act. The Guardian explains:\n\nSchedule 7 of the Terrorism Act has been widely criticised for giving police broad powers under the guise of anti-terror legislation to stop and search individuals without prior authorisation or reasonable suspicion \u2013 setting it apart from other police powers.\n\nThose stopped have no automatic right to legal advice and it is a criminal offence to refuse to co-operate with questioning under schedule 7, which critics say is a curtailment of the right to silence\n\nAs Greenwald pointed out in a statement made after his partner\u2019s detention, this will only fuel the fire for him to keep pressing further with these stories. And it should. This should be a wake-up call to journalists, press, and media outlets. The NSA surveillance programs were clearly meant to be kept secret. The intelligence sectors of the US and UK cannot be trusted to inform citizens of the truth. That is why there is a freedom of the press in the United States. This tremendous power should continue to be utilized to inform the public. Glenn Greenwald is doing a brave thing by reporting on such a controversial issue, but its his job.

From her birth as a French Colony to her coronation as the Crowning Jewel of the South, New Orleans has suffered a long history of death and destruction that has threatened the soul of the city as well as her inhabitants. Floods, fires, rampant disease outbreaks, and cold-blooded murders have left a veil over the city, a veil that is often lifted when the souls of the dead return to remind the living of their tortured past.\n\nAs we approach the 300th birthday of New Orleans, one must wonder if the souls of her long forgotten deceased will soon return to participate in this gala. Will the dearly and not-so-dearly departed return once again to celebrate alongside the living? In 2010 the New Orleans Ghost Hunters sought out to answer this very question. After several years of research, they have their answer.\n\nThe New Orleans Ghost Hunters was formed through a collaboration of professional individuals who had spent their entire lives in the Crescent City. Paranormal experiences each had growing up left them with two burning questions: are ghost real and can we capture physical evidence of paranormal activity? Since their conception the New Orleans Ghost Hunters have investigated numerous residential and historical locations. Their experiences and expertise in the field has led to them hosting paranormal conventions and a local and now international talk radio show and appearing as guest speakers at Wizard Word and on T.V.\n\nThe New Orleans Ghost Hunters now reveal their long awaited answer in their \u201cGhosts of the French Quarter Tour\u201d.
