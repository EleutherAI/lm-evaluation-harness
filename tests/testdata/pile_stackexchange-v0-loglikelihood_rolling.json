[["Q:\n\nInterpolate between observations (piecewise approximation) R\n\nI'm comparing some forecast data against actual values. The forecasts are obtained from three different providers. However, the time stamps for the actual data and the forecast data are not the same. I want to compare the error for each point where are forecast was made. \nIn the below snapshot, I'd like to get the difference of the forecast for each providers forecast from the actual value. The encircled points represent forecasts for which the actual data is not available but we can see there is a distinct trend. I think I would be okay with a piecewise approximation but i'm not sure how to do that. I've seen the answers posted in Need a R package for piecewise linear regression? but it's not very helpful. \n10-day sample:\n\n1-day sample showing the offset b/w forecast instances and actual data:\n\nsample data (for 1 day)\n> dput(dt)\nstructure(list(tme = structure(c(1516221000, 1516224600, 1516228200, \n1516231800, 1516235400, 1516239000, 1516242600, 1516246200, 1516249800, \n1516253400, 1516257000, 1516260600, 1516264200, 1516267800, 1516271400, \n1516275000, 1516278600, 1516282200, 1516285800, 1516289400, 1516293000, \n1516296600, 1516300200, 1516303800, 1516307400, 1516226400, 1516230000, \n1516233600, 1516237200, 1516240800, 1516244400, 1516248000, 1516251600, \n1516255200, 1516258800, 1516262400, 1516266000, 1516269600, 1516273200, \n1516276800, 1516280400, 1516284000, 1516287600, 1516291200, 1516294800, \n1516298400, 1516302000, 1516305600, 1516221000, 1516224600, 1516228200, \n1516231800, 1516235400, 1516239000, 1516242600, 1516246200, 1516249800, \n1516253400, 1516257000, 1516260600, 1516264200, 1516267800, 1516271400, \n1516275000, 1516278600, 1516282200, 1516285800, 1516289400, 1516293000, \n1516296600, 1516300200, 1516303800, 1516307400, 1516233600, 1516244400, \n1516255200, 1516266000, 1516276800, 1516287600, 1516298400), tzone = \"UTC\", class = c(\"POSIXct\", \n\"POSIXt\")), degc = c(2.25, 1.69, 2.22, 2.22, 1.65, 1.12, 2.22, \n1.1, 1.13, 2.82, 5.58, 7.8, 7.85, 8.43, 10.05, 10.06, 10.07, \n10.03, 8.89, 6.17, 5.04, 5.01, 3.92, 2.29, 2.29, -1, -1, -1, \n-1, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, \n-0.16, -1.13, -2.19, -2.98, -3.48, -3.86, -3.84, -2.96, -1.16, \n0.91, 2.61, 3.92, 4.84, 5.59, 6.68, 7.41, 6.82, 5.08, 3.07, 1.56, \n0.51, -0.36, -1.15, -1.86, -2.53, -0.2, -0.9, 4.1, 6.9, 8.1, \n3.6, 2.6), rh = c(0.55, 0.6, 0.51, 0.51, 0.6, 0.52, 0.55, 0.57, \n0.6, 0.49, 0.44, 0.41, 0.38, 0.36, 0.33, 0.33, 0.31, 0.33, 0.35, \n0.39, 0.4, 0.4, 0.43, 0.49, 0.49, 73, 73, 75, 75, 75, 71, 67, \n59, 52, 47, 42, 39, 37, 35, 34, 37, 43, 48, 51, 54, 58, 61, 62, \n0.61, 0.64, 0.67, 0.7, 0.72, 0.74, 0.74, 0.71, 0.65, 0.58, 0.54, \n0.52, 0.51, 0.5, 0.46, 0.44, 0.45, 0.5, 0.57, 0.61, 0.64, 0.65, \n0.67, 0.69, 0.71, 59.1, 62.6, 43.9, 36.7, 33.2, 46.4, 50.1), \n    type = c(\"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \n    \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \n    \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \n    \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \n    \"Actual\", \"Actual\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \n    \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \n    \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \n    \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \n    \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \"Provider W\", \n    \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \n    \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \n    \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \n    \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \n    \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \"Provider D\", \n    \"Provider B\", \"Provider B\", \"Provider B\", \"Provider B\", \"Provider B\", \n    \"Provider B\", \"Provider B\")), .Names = c(\"tme\", \"degc\", \"rh\", \n\"type\"), row.names = c(NA, -80L), class = c(\"data.table\", \"data.frame\"\n), .internal.selfref = <pointer: 0x0000000000120788>)\n\nI'm really not sure on how to proceed with this. I need to repeat this exercise for several datasets (a few hundred rows each) with up to 30 variables (sample data only has two). \n\nA:\n\nI think that what you are asking for is this.\nfAct = approxfun(dt$tme[dt$type=='Actual'], dt$degc[dt$type=='Actual'], )\n\nThis gives a piecewise linear approximation to the Actual values.  You can then compare this with values from the various providers. For example,\n> dt[35,]\n                   tme degc rh       type\n35 2018-01-18 07:00:00    6 47 Provider W\n> fAct(dt[35,'tme'])\n[1] 6.69\n\nSo Provider W predicts that degc will be 6 at time 2018-01-18 07:00:00. The (approximation to the) Actual value is 6.69 so the error is 0.69.\nEdit\nAs noted by @RalfStubner,  you can get a smoother (non-linear) approximation using\nfAct2 = splinefun(dt$tme[dt$type=='Actual'], dt$degc[dt$type=='Actual'])\n\n"], ["Q:\n\nHow to jump from one activity to another and set a fragment\n\nWhat i want is when i jump from one activity to another with intent it should also automatically set a fragment inside framelayout but i can't figure out how to do that any help will be appreciated.\n\nA:\n\nIf I got your question correctly, this code should help you:\nIn your first activity put this code:\npublic static final String FRAGMENTA = \"FragmentA\";\npublic static final String FRAGMENTB = \"FragmentB\";\npublic static final String FRAGMENTC = \"FragmentB\";\n\nString fragmentToDisplay = FRAGMENTA;\nIntent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), SecondActivity.class);\nintent.putExtra(\"fragmentToDisplay\", fragmentToDisplay);\nstartActivity(intent);\n\nThen in your second activity in onCreate, receive the intent and set a fragment according to the string intent:\nString fragmentToDisplay = getIntent.getStringExtra(\"fragmentToDisplay\");\nswitch (fragmentToDisplay) {\n    case FirstActivity.FRAGMENTA:\n        //FragmentTransaction to show Fragment A\n        break;\n    case FirstActivity.FRAGMENTB:\n        //FragmentTransaction to show Fragment B\n        break;\n    case FirstActivity.FRAGMENTC:\n        //FragmentTransaction to show Fragment C\n        break;\n}\n\n"], ["Q:\n\nDisable CodeRush\n\nI do not want to uninstall code rush.

In other words, without being given the hash functions or the random string used for encoding, or even the length of it.\nEDIT: This is being used in tandem with RSA, but I don't know the hash functions that OAEP usually uses with RSA; they might be public, for all I know.\n\nA:\n\nIf you know the hash functions, yes.  If the hash functions are secret, no\u2014but how would you come into a situation where OAEP is being used with a secret hash function?\nFor any hash functions $G$ and $H$, OAEP is a fixed permutation involving no secret keys.  Specifically, given a message $m$ and randomization $r$, OAEP returns $(a, b)$ where\n\\begin{align}\n  a &= m \\oplus G(r), \\\\\n  b &= r \\oplus H(a),\n\\end{align}\nwhich can be inverted by\n\\begin{align}\n  r &= b \\oplus H(a), \\\\\n  m &= a \\oplus G(r).\n\\end{align}\nSo if you have $(a, b)$ and you can compute $G$ and $H$, you can recover $m$ (and $r$).

There are 2-dimensional manifolds such as the Klein bottle that cannot be realized (without self-intersection) as 2-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. \nThe Whitney embedding theorem says that a $k$-dimensional manifold can be diffeomorphically embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^{2k}$ iff its topology is Hausdorff and second countable.
