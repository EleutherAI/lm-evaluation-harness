[["#ubuntu-app-devel 2012-07-09\n<will__> hey guys. i need a way to specify \"prefer\", \"don't mind\", \"prefer not\" and \"can't\" for each day of the week. here's my two alternatives i can think of: a grid of checkboxes, with prefer/prefer not etc. being vertical axis and days of week being horizontal\n<will__> or simply a combobox for each day of the week\n<will__> what do you think is the best out of the two? any other ways to let users choose?\n<Will123> hey guys. I have a group of radio boxes, and the choices are \"prefers to work the same days every week\" or \"prefers to work different days every week\"\n<Will123> that's pretty inelegant. does anyone have any ideas about what would make better radio button labels and an overall frame label?\n<Will123> (\"Prefers to work...     [x] same days every week [ ] different days every week\" seems a bit gross\n<Will123> getting a bit tense now\n<dpm> good morning\n<dholbach> good morning\n<Will123> hello\n<Will123> i haven't slept in quite a long time\n<Will123> but i'm determined to finish my program in time\n<Will123> does the code quality matter at all in the judging?\n<Will123> there's stuff in here i wouldn't show my parents let alone feel comfortable showing you guys\n<dpm> Will123, we won't review the code, but for the app's stability, it'd be nice to have robust code. Crashes will obviously score negatively\n<Will123> dpm: yeah, that makes sense\n<Will123> unfortunately due to the time constraints i've had to rush a lot of things and add a lot of horrible hacks. obviously i'm avoiding crashes but post-competition i'd like to go over and touch it up\n<Will123> and bulldoze some of it down\n<robotex> Hello\n<robotex> I created app for Ubuntu Showdown\n<robotex> But I used Qt4, not Quickly\n<robotex> So, how can I create package?\n<sigurdga> robotex: I'm lazy, but I would probably try to get your program to be started by the __init__.py inside quickly\n<dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Submissions/PackageQuickStart might help\n<sigurdga> I'm using gtk, but without Glade or Builder, but quickly runs my python program just fine\n<Will123> sigurdga: have you tried any unity shell integration yet?\n<robotex> XB-Icon: is the filename of the app icon. (This must exactly match the icon filename added to the package meta-data in the debian/rules file.)\n<robotex> XB-Screenshot-Url: is the URL to a screenshot image. This is the screenshot image you upload with your review request, and the URL should be on https://software-center.ubuntu.com.\n<robotex> Do I must to download somewhere this images and writes URLs?\n<robotex> Or this is patches to images in repository?\n<sigurdga> Will123: Only drop file to launcher icon (to open a file in the program), that's all I need, I think.\n<dpm> robotex, don't worry about these, IIRC they are now handled by myapps.developer.ubuntu.com, so you can ignore them for now\n<robotex> so, don't add this lines?\n<Will123> sigurdga: fair enough :) i've not managed it myself\n<robotex> just this lines or all XB- ?\n<Will123> guys, i couldn't get drag and drop in my application to work, so as a rubbish work around I have a button on the widget that you click, then you click on another destination widget (simulating the kind of thing you'd do with drag and drop)\n<sigurdga> Will123: I have nothing that needs indicators or message popups or anything like that\n<Will123> however i've got nothing that makes it obvious that you're suddenly in the \"associate this object with another one by clicking it\" mode\n<Will123> any ideas? what should i do? have a big label that appears saying \"you're now in such and such a mode\"?\n<sigurdga> Will123: that was what came into my mind as well (the big label)\n<Will123> sigurdga: glad it's not too crazy an idea then. :) where do you think i should put it? a status bar at the bottom of the window is too out of the way, and i don't really want to move all my widgets down to fit in a big label at the top. i don't know how to make a temporary popup (infact when i tried, it crashed everything horribly). i'm even considering putting it in the toolbar\n<Will123> sigurdga: (i've not got any use for indicators or message pop ups either)\n<robotex> about rules file:\n<sigurdga> Will123: I'm not so good at this, but I would put a label at the top. I think you can hide() and show() it to enable it when you want to show it.\n<robotex> You must add a small piece to set up the app icon in the Software Center. (It's a bit ugly, but there's no other way to do it at the moment.) Define an override_dh_gencontrol target that copies your image icon outside the top-level directory (to \"../myapp.png\"), and then adds the icon to the package meta-data. The name of the file added to the package meta-data must exactly match the XB-Icon filename in the debian/control file. It has to be a\n<robotex> PNG icon, and not SVG or some other format.\n<robotex> is this necessary?\n<Will123> sigurdga: i'll give it a go, thanks :)\n<robotex> Oh\n<robotex> override_dh_gencontrol:\n<robotex>         dh_gencontrol\n<robotex>         cp icons/myapp-64x64.png ../myapp.png\n<robotex>         dpkg-distaddfile myapp.png raw-meta-data -\n<robotex> if this icon folder must be located in debian directory or upper?\n<dpm> robotex, you can do 'quickly create ubuntu-application foo', 'cd foo', 'quickly package --extras' and then use the generated debian/rules and debian/control files for your example\n<dpm> assuming you're using PyQt or PySide\n<robotex> not python\n<robotex> c++\n<robotex> in desktop file it must be only SVG icon?\n<robotex> Can I use PNG?\n<robotex> ok, I'm doing debuild\n<robotex> but see error\n<robotex> debian/rules:13: *** missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?).  Stop.\n<robotex> but I don't have TABs in this file\n<robotex> what's wrong?\n<robotex> dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -D -us -uc failed\n<robotex> robotex@robotex-laptop:~/workspace/mirrorcam-1.0$ fakeroot debian/rules clean\n<robotex> debian/rules:13: *** missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?).  Stop.\n<robotex> what's wrong?\n<robotex> there is no Tabs in this file\n<dholbach> robotex, try opening the file in vim for example - it should show you if there's tabs instead of spaces\n<robotex> is tabs looks like as red lines in vim?\n<dholbach> yes\n<dholbach> change the tab to 8 spaces\n<dholbach> and configure your editor to use spaces instead of tabs :)\n<dholbach> and you should be fine\n<robotex> how to input in vim? :)\n<robotex> I press space, cursor moving, but not inputing\n<psychognite> helo evry one\n<psychognite> i have a project to submit in app showdown i don't how to submit it ..... please help me out.. !!\n<robotex> <dholbach>, no. Red lines is a spaces\n<commandoline> psychognite: http://developer.ubuntu.com/showdown/ step 4, what's going wrong?\n<dholbach> robotex, maybe the indentation is wrong?\n<robotex> 8 spaces\n<psychognite> i used quickly to build a package from my project then dput <launcpadinfo>  doesn't work\n<commandoline> psychognite: do you have an error message?\n<psychognite> yes\n<psychognite> sir\n<robotex> <dholbach>, you are wrong. I changed all to TABs and problem gone\n<robotex> but I see next problem\n<psychognite> by using quickly package i build .deb .changes .tar.gz .dsc files now what to do next\n<dholbach> robotex, haha, yes, you're right - I misread the error message above\n * dholbach might need another cup of tea or coffee\n<psychognite> i have creates openpgp keys for launchpad and code of conduct\n<commandoline> psychognite: try quickly submitubuntu , then it also handles uploading to the ppa as far as I know.\n<psychognite> error occured:\n<psychognite> Get Launchpad Settings\n<psychognite> Launchpad connection is ok\n<psychognite> No Launchpad project set, leave blank to abort.\n<psychognite> Launchpad project name: No launchpad project given, aborting.\n<psychognite> ERROR: submitubuntu command failed\n<psychognite> Aborting\n<robotex> It's compiling!\n<robotex> Yahoo!\n<robotex> Done!\n<commandoline> psychognite: see http://askubuntu.com/questions/158853/no-launchpad-project-set-when-running-quickly-submitubuntu\n<commandoline> (in short, creating a launchpad project like submitubuntu wants to have should work)\n<robotex> my first deb package in a life ^_^\n<psychognite> sir i m out of my mind what should b my next step .. ?\n<robotex> hm, but when I successfully install this package I don't see the app\n<robotex> so, I get many files\n<robotex> what can I do with it?\n<psychognite> i have created ppa and don't know how to upload my files...... can anyone do help me out ... !!!\n<robotex> if it normal that I don't see my app in /opt?\n<robotex> and I don't see it in dash\n<robotex> What?! Why package is empty? 0_o\n<robotex> What did I do wrong?\n<jml> psychognite: try 'quickly upload'\n<robotex> if it normal?\n<robotex> This package has a Debian revision number but there does not seem to be\n<robotex> an appropriate original tar file or .orig directory in the parent directory;\n<robotex> (expected one of mirrorcam_1.0.orig.tar.gz, mirrorcam_1.0.orig.tar.bz2,\n<robotex> mirrorcam_1.0.orig.tar.lzma,  mirrorcam_1.0.orig.tar.xz or mirrorcam-1.0.orig)\n<robotex> continue anyway?

Debs do, they just don't contain the requirements (those are already in the repositories)\n<robotex> <commandoline>, but where my app files? I opened deb by ark and didn't seen it\n<commandoline> robotex: well, if your files are nowhere in there, there's something wrong I'd say.\n<robotex> oh god\n<robotex> why is it so difficult\n<robotex> Can somebody see my project http://ubuntuone.com/2y9yodNKHTiOlWqSreUlAr and say what is wrong?\n<dpm> the fact that it's so hard is one of the main reasons we created Quickly\n<robotex> yes, Quickly is good\n<dpm> dholbach is a bit busy right now, but perhaps coolbhavi or ajmitch can have a look at your package and give you a hand if they're around ^\n<robotex> in archive I included generated files and my source dir with debian dir\n<dpm> robotex, have you got your code somewhere online? It would help reviewers a lot. This might be helpful if you haven't published your code yet: http://askubuntu.com/questions/154129/how-can-i-publish-my-project-code-online-so-someone-can-help-me-with-it\n<robotex> <dpm>, if you want to see project code you can do this there https://github.com/NicholasShatokhin/mirrorcam\n<robotex> but in my archive in UbuntuOne you can see also debian files that need for generating deb package and result files\n<dpm> ok, cool, glad to see it's online, that will be useful for anyone who can help you\n<psychognite> sir i have uploaded my package on launchpad now how to indulge in app showdown competition\n<dpm> psychognite, it's all explained on http://developer.ubuntu.com/showdown. If any of the steps is not clear, please, let us know\n<psychognite> sir i have go through all but now i am struct where i could know my app is on compettion\n<robotex> can anybody see my code at github? https://github.com/NicholasShatokhin/mirrorcam.git I commited debian files\n<robotex> how to say debuild put files in bin dir, not in dir with sources?\n<psychognite> tata bye bye\n<robotex> what dirs must be in source dir before packaging started?\n<MetalGodWin> Hello, I'm having problem with packaging my python-app, could use some help.\n<MetalGodWin> I've installed it with \"sudo dpkg --install appyours_0.3-1ubuntu0_amd64.deb\"\n<MetalGodWin> Shouldn't I be able to start it system-wide running \"appyours\" from the terminal?\n<Will123> what happens when you try that?\n<MetalGodWin> command not found\n<MetalGodWin> if i run python appyours it says \"/usr/bin/python: can't find '__main__' module in 'appyours'\"\n<robotex> On the next shutdown I will try to write quickly for Qt4 + C++\n<robotex> *showdown\n<MetalGodWin> I'm following this guide (http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/packaging-new-software.html) but it might not apply to python-apps?\n<MetalGodWin> From some guide: \"If you're packaging a Python module, section should be python, but not for applications.\"\n<MetalGodWin> Not 100% sure on this.. as I got a python-app. Should I stick with devel, or use python instead?\n<coolbhavi> robotex, hey\n<coolbhavi> dpm, sorry missed the ping :)\n<coolbhavi> robotex, why are you including cmake files inside debian directory?\n<coolbhavi> oops sorry I took a look wrongly\n<robotex> <coolbhavi>, are you so some wrong in configs?\n<coolbhavi> robotex, why is the source field blank in d/copyright\n<coolbhavi> ?\n<robotex> <coolbhavi>, debian/copyright?\n<coolbhavi> yes the copyright file under the debian/ dir\n<robotex> hm, my fault\n<coolbhavi> and your package requires qmake I guess\n<robotex> for building\n<coolbhavi> yes\n<robotex> it's first package in my life\n<coolbhavi> ok :-) it just ftbfs I found qmake missing on my system so installing it now\n<robotex> I think in debian missing some scripts that must copy binaries into deb package\n<robotex> wait\n<robotex> hm\n<MetalGodWin> No one got a clue on what could be wrong? Can't run my app after installed it, if i use \"python appyours\" then it says \"/usr/bin/python: can't find '__main__' module in 'appyours'\"\n<coolbhavi> yes m just test building let me see the results\n<robotex> I added something and now debuild copy pictures into package\n<coolbhavi> robotex, I think you need qt4-qmake as a build dependency\n<coolbhavi> otherwise it fails to build\n<coolbhavi> from source\n<robotex> /usr/share/pixmaps is it correct path for icons?\n<robotex> Must I add lib*-dev to build decencies ?\n<coolbhavi> just a moment m test building\n<coolbhavi> generally pixmaps could do btw\n<coolbhavi> for icons\n<robotex> is debian/rules correct?\n<robotex> must I add files <package_name>.install and <package_name>-dev.install or it's only for libraries?\n<coolbhavi> no as of now I found just adding qt4-qmake to build dep in debian/control solves the 1st check\n<coolbhavi> just some time pls I am just building the package now\n<wooo> hey can anyone tell me how much time is left for submission of  The Ubuntu App Showdown!!\n<wooo> its urgent...\n<will> you have until midnight, but i recommend getting it in before then\n<coolbhavi> robotex, also I found XB-Screenshot-Url:  missing in debian/control\n<wooo> i have made application in c language.can anyone tell me how to package it and submit it??\n<coolbhavi> wooo, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Submissions/PackageQuickStart\n<robotex> <wooo>, 8 hours\n<robotex> wooo, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Submissions/PackageQuickStart\n<coolbhavi> robotex, and also try to wrap the long description in debian/control to 80 chars per line\n<robotex> <coolbhavi>, ok\n<markus__> hi all\n<markus__> im one of the App Showdown particiants\n<markus__> I jkust wanted to upload, now I read deadline is over?!\n<markus__> or is the countdown @ http://developer.ubuntu.com/2012/07/ubuntu-app-showdown-deadline-approaching-get-your-submissions-ready/ wrong?\n<markus__> becuase several hours ago it said till midnight UTC\n<markus__> hi zoopster\n<markus__> when is App Showdon deadline?!\n<will> i hope the deadline hasn't passed\n<will> i'm still working\n<zoopster> no idea markus__ it says 9 july\n<markus__> which time zone?\n<markus__> kk, I'll upload any way\n<zoopster> doesn't give a timezone\n<wooo> markus__: on that website also it is mentioned 1 day left.\n<zoopster> dpm: ^^\n<sigurdga> I had the counter up from earlier, and it stated 8 hours plus.

There's no /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/app/share/locale directory created. How do I fix this?\n<robotex> omg, I don't see timer any more?\n<robotex> Can I still send app?\n<MetalGodWin> Still could use some guidance on packaging a python app if anyone is up for it. Been at it for hours now\n<robotex> guys, where debuild gets paths for compiling? I moving sources, how to tell debuild where it?\n<robotex> anybody knows?\n<markus__> did have huge problems too\n<markus__> but got it after some hjours\n<markus__> MetalGodWin whats ur problem?\n<MetalGodWin> not sure on what i should fill in on build-depends or depends in the control file.\n<markus__> did u do the python app with quickly?\n<MetalGodWin> nope, from scratch by hand\n<markus__> (quickly edit)\n<markus__> ah, hmm... okay... then I  can't help. I had huge problems with quickly submitubuntu, an thought that's the problem\n<MetalGodWin> well, python coding from scratch.. could one soltion be to create a quickly app, then merge my sourcefiles with that project?\n<sigurdga> MetalGodWin: That should work\n<commandoline> depends is for dependencies when running, build-depends for dependencies while building the application\n<commandoline> MetalGodWin: that's probably the easier solution\n<MetalGodWin> commandoline, markus__ thanks.

Done\n<robotex> How to send app?\n<sigurdga> When you submitted on the development site, you should not upload file, you should make comment about PPA, using the defined format. But it is not easy to understand if you comment has been submitted or not, as it looks like it failed because of missing binary.\n<sigurdga> Getting tired of all these forms, I was finished with my app several hours ago.\n<robotex> I don't understand\n<robotex> Must I turn checkbox I load my app later?\n<robotex> Where do I must upload text file for showdown?\n<robotex> where must I put comment?\n<robotex> where can I get format?\n<robotex> <sigurdga>, can you explain what can I do?\n<sigurdga> I actually got it now.

(Nice work, btw.)  What it really boiled down to for me was learning some of the Python-Gtk bindings, and quick introduction to Glade.\n<hoonteke> I'm now trying to test some limits of the Python GTK functionality by augmenting the mini webbrowser to various actions based on os signals.  (e.g. SIGUSR1, SIGHUP, etc.).  Note that these are specifically *not* the signals of slots and signals that I keep finding when I use \"Gtk\" and \"signals\" as Google search terms.\n<hoonteke> I've connected the signals as I'm aware how to do with Python's signal.signal functionality, but now I'm falling victim to the third bullet point of http://docs.python.org/library/signal.html .  Is there some way I can register -- through the gi.repository.Gtk bindings -- a handler for *OS* signals?\n<sigurdga> dpm: I couldn't find my app on the Trello board: https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/1297\n<jvrbanac> sigurdga: https://davidplanella.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/heads-up-to-all-ubuntu-app-showdown-participants/https://davidplanella.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/heads-up-to-all-ubuntu-app-showdown-participants/\n<jvrbanac> Woops sorry!

I had a quick question, I received an email back from submitting an app to the app showdown, and it said some changes were made, and then \"I'll submit it for vote for inclusion in Ubuntu Extras.\" I would assume this means I should take no action? However, the email also said, as part of the standard template, that I should make the changes and resubmit the application.  Also, my...\n<hupahuper> ...status on myapps is Needs information. He said he posted the revised edition on a ppa which he linked, so should I resubmit and point to that ppa? Or merge, then resubmit with new ppa?\n<hupahuper> I emailed him back, so I will see if he responds, thanks!\n<noodles775> Morning dholbach\n<dholbach> good morning\n<dholbach> :-P\n * dholbach hugs noodles775\n<noodles775> :)\n<mister_> Hello, I am writing a python app for Ubuntu.

All that is built in there is synced to extras.ubuntu.com, but I think there is a Launchpad branch where you can see the code changes\n<dpm> which is probably https://code.launchpad.net/~dholbach/ubuntu-app-reviews/pictag\n<zoopster> dpm:  apps.ubuntu.com is updated 1x per day around midnight utc\n<dpm> toabctl, ^\n<dpm> thanks zoopster\n<zoopster> sure\n<toabctl> thanks zoopster , dpm\n<coolbhavi> dpm, hey! how are you doing?\n<dpm> heya coolbhavi, good, thanks, and you? :)\n<coolbhavi> dpm, doing good :) Just realising how painful app reviews can be at times :)\n * coolbhavi just voted a +0 on one of the apps\n<crazycoder1999> Hi, I have a project made with quickly and I need to change my debian/copyright because, the one that quickly create with \"quickly submitubuntu\" command is bugged... any idea? more information here : http://askubuntu.com/questions/162718/quickly-creates-wrong-debian-copyright-file\n * crazycoder1999 lost in quickly..\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2012-07-13\n<bretth> if i write an app that uses \"Application Indicators\" for Ubuntu12.04, will it be backwards compatible with Ubuntu11.x ?\n<bretth> (using Python)\n<mths> what's the language for ubuntu development?\n<mths> hello?\n<mths> anyone here?\n<bretth> mths, python\n<bretth> i notice that from python i can \"import appindicator\"\n<bretth> is that a valid way for my script to know that it is running in Ubuntu Unity?\n<bretth> for example if my script needs to also support, Gnome3 or Cinnamon.\n<dholbach> good morning\n<dpm> morning dholbach\n<dpm> good morning all\n<toabctl> dholbach, dpm is it possible to update the pictag package? the dependencies are wong. see #1024165\n<dholbach> toabctl, send a mail to the ARB list with a link to a branch or source package please\n<toabctl> dholbach, ok. thx\n<int_ua> Hi :) Is it ok that my app is pending for re-review 9 hours since I've fixed the  problem with it?\n<john__> Hi, I am using subprocess.Popen in my app. I am giving a file path as an argument but when there is a space, python only reads argument string upto the space and ignores rest.

I am going to begin developing an open source program from an idea I have. My focus in the beginning is having it for Ubuntu/Linux distros. However, if it takes off I would like to be able to release windows/mac os x versions. Java is not an option and is actually THE reason I am developing this program because java has too many issues (performance mostly) on linux unless you have a blazing fast machine. What\n<mikehaas763>  are some good language/gui kit combos to use?\n<Phoenix87> mikehaas763: wxwidgets and python maybe\n<int_ua> <mikehaas763> python/Qt ?\n<toabctl> dholbach, dpm when i try to update my app with quickly, quickly changes debian/control and debian/changelog. i wanted to fix #1024165 and wanted to release a new version with \"quickly submitubuntu\" but the result is not usable.\n<toabctl> see http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~toabctl/pictag/quickly_trunk/revision/55\n<dholbach> I'm afraid I don't know how to deal with this\n<Phoenix87> My app is in the Waiting on Developer list on Trello but doesn't show up in the Contestants list. How is that so?\n<Phoenix87> mterry: also, if you ha ve a couple of spare mins, could you help me with definitively solving this? https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/1274/feedback/ thanks\n<mterry> Phoenix87, hello!\n<Phoenix87> mterry: hi\n<mterry> Phoenix87, so the desktop issue is tricky, since quickly likes to override debian/rules and such.  Your modifications won't keep.\n<Phoenix87> mterry: i prefer to stop using quickly for now\n<mterry> Phoenix87, the debian/rules that quickly uses for submitubuntu in 12.04 has several hacks like moving the desktop file and fixing up paths\n<mterry> Phoenix87, OK\n<mterry> Phoenix87, so let's start with the base that quickly gives you.  Let me see what 12.04's quickly's debian/rules looks like\n<Phoenix87> mterry: anyway is the deb i have uploaded on my ppa good, or do I have to push another version?\n<Phoenix87> ok\n<mterry> Phoenix87, it certainly installs into /opt, but as you noted, the user can't run it  :-/\n<Phoenix87> mterry: oh so this is the version that will be included in the software center? I though that the current deb would serve as the purpouse of judgement only\n<mterry> Phoenix87, I don't know actually.  I'm not judging this, I just work on quickly\n<Phoenix87> mterry: another issue is that related to the prerm and postinst scripts. If i manually package my app with debuild -S they are not included in the deb compiled by launchpad\n<Phoenix87> mterry: this is the debian/rules generated by 12.04: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1090418/\n<mterry> Phoenix87, hah, you wish it were that simple.  If you package --extras with up-to-date 12.04: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1090415/\n<mterry> so there is a lot of junk there, which I can explain.  You might only want some of it\n<Phoenix87> mterry: ops i forgot --extras\n<mterry> Some of that is working around sub-optimal setup.py that earlier versions of quickly shipped.\n<Phoenix87> mterry: ok now my rules looks pretty much like yours\n<mterry> But that desktop section at least is important (moving it and sed'ing it)\n<mterry> And same with the DATA_DIRS and gsettings stuff if you use gsettings\n<mterry> OK\n<mterry> So do you know how to manually package up an app?\n<Phoenix87> mterry: i guess so\n<Phoenix87> mterry: I have used the combo debuild / dput to have the job done\n<mterry> Yup, just that should do it.  debuild -S -i -I and dput ppa:\n<Phoenix87> mterry: the deb currently in my ppa has been manually packaged like this\n<mterry> cool\n<Phoenix87> mterry: but as I mentioned earlier, that deb is missing prerm and postinst\n<Phoenix87> I had to manually add them into the debian folder in order to have them show up in the deb\n<mterry> That's good.  You shouldn't need them...   What was in them?\n<Phoenix87> the PYTHON_MODULES stuff\n<Phoenix87> without them the program won't run issuing /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/gtumbler/bin/gtumbler\n<Phoenix87> it raises a import module name not found\n<Phoenix87> i guess this is due to the fact that it is installing into /opt\n<mterry> Ah, OK...  Well as long as you got it working now\n<Phoenix87> mterry: so it is OK to manually include those scripts?\n<mterry> Phoenix87, if they are needed...  I'm not actually familiar with that side of the issue.  I didn't think they were needed, but you sound like you've talked to dholbach about it, who is authoritative for such things\n<Phoenix87> mterry: yeah but I didn't receive a reply from him about this, so I'm not sure about it\n<mterry> Phoenix87, well, I thought they weren't needed for /opt, but again, my recollection is less important than whether they are needed in practice.  :)\n<mterry> hold on a sec, let me ask stgraber\n<Geochr> Hi all, I have succesfully publishe a magazine in Ubuntu software center but is available only in 12.04... How can i make the magazine available not only in 12.04 ?\n<Phoenix87> mterry: ok. thank you! :D\n<mterry> or rather, jump into #ubuntu-arb for a sec\n<mterry> And ask yourself, since I'm not sure I'm going to ask it right\n<Geochr> is there any help ?\n<zoopster> Geochr: what mag and what distroseries do you want to make it availablef for?\n<zoopster> Geochr: we default to the latest, but you can request others in the feedback...if it's already published, I can make it available in other distroseries\n<Geochr> zoopster,  the magazine called \"Ubuntistas\" and we want to be available and in other  distroseries\n<zoopster> Geochr: which others? I can go back to maverick if you wish\n<zoopster> Geochr: I take that back...I can only go back to natty now since mav is eol\n<Geochr> ok from natty since prencise then\n<zoopster> Geochr: ok #14 is done (give it a bit to show up) and #13 will be when it passes qa on Monday\n<zoopster> Geochr: just put that request in the feedback when you submit\n<Geochr> zoopster, thanks a lot\n<hiuhu> Anyone good with php programming please help me understand this code coz am stuck @ http://pastebin.com/3hAMaFVt\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2012-07-14\n<johhnn> Hello, I am using GtkEntry to get user input in my app. Is it possible to remember this input and set it to entrybox when the app is closed and launched again?\n<johhnn> The text field resets when the app is launched again.\n<commandoline> johhnn: how about saving the contents as a setting?\n<johhnn> How to do that? I am making app for the first time :)\n<commandoline> hmm, just a moment, I'll see if I can find some details for GTK (I'm using Qt myself)\n<commandoline> ok, it looks like a window has a 'delete-event' (that's how it's literally called in GTK)\n<commandoline> if you react on that by saving the setting, e.g. via the http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html module if you're using python.\n<commandoline> and just read out the setting again when starting.\n<johhnn> I found a guide for gsettings --> http://www.micahcarrick.com/gsettings-python-gnome-3.html\n<commandoline> fine too\n<johhnn> yeah thanks for the link, i am reading it now :)\n<commandoline> The last approach is what gnome apps would typically do, but it looks like a bit more work to me (writing a scheme first). Just use whatever you prefer.\n<johhnn> commandoline: hey thanks configparser works like charm, feels like magic :)\n<imnichol> I'm using quickly and I'd like to have a list of things, what widget should I use?\n<commandoline> http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/treeview.html I'd think (but I'm not a GTK dev myself)\n<commandoline> imnichol: ^\n<imnichol> Thanks commandoline\n<Phoenix87> any idea about how I can get rid of /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/overrides/Gtk.py:391: Warning: g_object_set_property: construct property \"type\" for object `Window' can't be set after construction\n<guinea-pig> Phoenix87: it's not in your project\n<guinea-pig> https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678510\n<guinea-pig> http://git.gnome.org/browse/pygobject/commit/?id=de4aa426002eeb09a060f8fd70bd6cb25a17766a\n<ubot2> Gnome bug 678510 in introspection \"g_object_set_property: construct property \"type\" for object `Window' can't be set after construction\" [Minor,Resolved: fixed]\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2013-07-08\n<dpm> good morning all\n<AskUbuntu> Cross compile LibzDb fro ARM A9 based Micro processor | http://askubuntu.com/q/317664\n<dholbach> good morning\n<oSoMoN> good morning dholbach\n<dholbach> hey oSoMoN\n<devinceble> Does qtdeclarative5-hud1.0 library present on 13.04 or 13.10 only?

I did that for consistency with animations but don't really mind\n<Kaleo_> Laney: yeah, I 'd rather\n<Laney> sure\n<Kaleo_> Laney: oh, and I just pushed another commit to that branch which fixes the FIXME\n<Laney> oh good!\n<Laney> These weird behaviours are quite confusing\n<Kaleo_> Laney: so if you merge that branch, fix 15) & 16) and I guess some unit tests failures, we are good :)\n<Kaleo_> Laney: this last behaviour is indeed a badie\n<oSoMoN> Kaleo_: hey, would you have a moment to review https://code.launchpad.net/~osomon/webbrowser-app/ubuntu-colors/+merge/173458 ?\n<Laney> Kaleo_: The unit tests are indeed broken now and I don't understand why. :)\n<Kaleo_> Laney: currentImage.status is not the actualy status\n<Kaleo_> Laney: since currentImage != nextImage\n<Kaleo_> Laney: even though it really is the nextImage that is loading\n<Kaleo_> Laney: (that was my intuition anyway)\n<Laney> it's the running property\n<Laney> the test_duration one\n<Kaleo_> oSoMoN: it's good to go; however once the theme color palette lands (tomorrow), we should use that whenever possible\n<oSoMoN> Kaleo_: yes, so when that lands I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do another pass and talk to design to use as many theme colors as possible\n<Kaleo_> oSoMoN: great\n<Laney> Kaleo_: what if I have the global status be set in onStatusChanged of both the Images?\n<Laney> so it becomes the most recent status to be updated\n<Kaleo_> Laney: not very pretty\n<Laney> I'm otherwise stuck with how to fix it\n<Laney> other than going back to what I had before there\n<Kaleo_> Laney: best would be to have currentImage really be the current image\n<Kaleo_> Laney: ok, I'll have a look\n<Kaleo_> Laney: everything else good?\n<Laney> seems so\n<Laney> I'll push\n<Kaleo_> Laney: thanks\n<Laney> done\n<nic-doffay> Kaleo_, or anyone else who has some investment in this.

nik90, disable the ppa anyway, or it will try to upgrade the packages using it again, it seems to raring packages in the ppa are newer than the saucy version\n<nik90> seb128: ok\n<seb128> nik90, let me know if the command I just gave work\n<nik90> seb128: nope it did not work\n<seb128> nik90, can you pastebin the error?\n<nik90> seb128: so I removed the PPA adn then am updating\n<nik90>

http://paste.ubuntu.com/5859371/\n<seb128> or keep trying and add things that are listed in error\n<nik90> seb128: that's a lot of packages to do \"sudo apt-get install binary/saucy otherbinary/saucy

published\n<kaleo> mhall119, they are\n<nik90> so at the end of the day, does saucy need the qt5-proper PPA or not?\n<kaleo> mhall119, it's just that the PPA has incorrect versions of Qt\n<kaleo> nik90, no\n<nik90> kaleo: mhall119: then the developer.ubuntu.com needs an update definitely\n<nik90> http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/\n<kaleo> nik90, it does not talk about Saucy (13.10) :)\n<nik90> kaleo: it does say \"a development release\" which is saucy\n<nik90> Alternatively, for those using Ubuntu 13.04 or a development release:\n<kaleo> nik90,  ah ah\n<kaleo> nik90, right\n<mhall119> kaleo: do we have package version conflicts between the saucy archives and the PPA?\n<nik90> kaleo: would I need the sdk-ppa then?\n<nik90> or shall i remove that as well\n<kaleo> mhall119, it kind of looks like it\n<mhall119> :/\n<kaleo> nik90, no\n<kaleo> nik90, saucy has everything\n<nik90> ok\n<renato_> timp, I am having problems with popover and keyboard, could you help me?\n<renato_> kaleo, who can help me with a popover problem?\n<kaleo> renato_, timp can\n<kaleo> renato_, by keyboard you mean keyboard navigation?\n<kaleo> renato_, the best is to report the bug first\n<kaleo> renato_, send an email to timp with the link (I believe he is EOD)\n<renato_> kaleo, no, the problem is that, just after the popover appear I ask the keyboard to dismiss, and then my item that is anchored to the popover moves but the popover does not follow it\n<renato_> kaleo, do you know if there is a easy way to fix that?\n<kaleo> renato_, don't know\n<kaleo> renato_, definitely a bug\n<renato_> ok I will report a bug\n<kaleo> renato_, thanks\n<renato_> kaleo, can I assign it to timp?\n<kaleo> renato_, yes\n<renato_> kaleo, ok thanks\n<renato_> kaleo,

The part on configuring Launchpad on the instructions should be good to go, but the part on internationalizing the code is a bit more complex and will take me some more time\n<popey> dpm: ok, found a problem\n<popey> step 4 of Series-specific settings\n<popey> https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu-terminal-app/trunk\n<popey> \"Click on the Change synchronization settings link in the Automatic synchronization section\"\n<popey> I see no \"change synchronization\"\n * dpm tries\n * dpm fixes\n<popey> we should be keeping a track of these things we're fixing in the hackday for later reporting\n * popey makes a doc\n<dpm> popey, fixed it, thanks! -> the link to click on is \"Set up branch synchronization\"\n<dpm> good idea\n<popey> done, added you to the doc and mhall119 and jono\n<popey> lets try and keep it updated as we go\n<dpm> popey, cool, jono will just love another google doc ;)\n * dpm thinks it's a good idea to keep track of the activities and report them\n<popey> ok, done terminal app as per your instructions, can you check it's okay please?\n<popey> and I'll do the others\n<UbuPhillup> if i open calendar-app in the menu the translation for german are too long: http://ubuntuone.com/2kxGeCLQGDEtLMTnvka7Qh is this a known bug, because its in all translated core-app\n<andricorso> hello\n<popey> hello andricorso\n<UbuPhillup> which have a menu\n<popey> UbuPhillup: not a known bug that I'm aware of\n<thor_> hello all :)\n<popey> hi thor_\n<rahulmahamna> hello\n<popey> hi\n<Owlree> hello, people\n<UbuPhillup> popey: so shoud i report it?\n<rahulmahamna> anybody here ?????\n<popey> UbuPhillup: please do!\n<popey> rahulmahamna: lots\n<rahulmahamna> jalkjflkajfl\n<dpm> hi thor_, Owlree UbuPhillup and everyone else!

When you've got some time, it'd also be great if you could look at https://code.launchpad.net/~pkunal-parmar/ubuntu-calendar-app/yearview/+merge/173743\n<oSoMoN> dpm: yeah, will do\n<Mirv> dpm: initially it sounds like not everything would have been updated\n<Mirv> I'm checking how does my raring chroot look like\n<Mirv> all up-to-date, qtcreator starts fine\n<Mirv> dpm: thor_: I don't directly know what could be wrong, so it'd need some tinkering to try to find what's the issue. among else dpkg -l *qt* | grep 5.0.1 should only show qtwebkit packages\n<Mirv> that error message occurs if some of the libraries that Qt doesn't allow to be different version, is different version, and specifically says some library would be 5.0.1 while others 5.0.2\n<Mirv> dpkg -l qtcreator | cat should give 2.7.1-0ubuntu1~raring1~test10 as the Qt Creator version\n<thor_> @Mirv : i purged all qt4* and libqt5* packages, reinstalled ubuntu-sdk and it worked\n<thor_> thanks\n<Mirv> thor_: hmmkay :P good that you found a solution.\n<WebbyIT> My second mr for calendar app: https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-calendar-app/1198652/+merge/173901 (I did today my last exam, so now I have a lot of free time for utouch) :D\n<dpm> WebbyIT, excellent, thanks!\n<dpm> WebbyIT, glad to hear that, your help on calendar is much welcome :-)\n<WebbyIT> dpm: i don't know if you remember, but i started to collaborate about two months ago, unfortunately university takes me a lot of time, so i didn't do much, but now i will recover the time lost :)\n<dpm> WebbyIT, I do remember, glad to have you back!\n<dpm> popey, do you want to join #qt-labs? We might be getting some traction on the Virtualbox qmlscene bug\n<dpm> and they have some questions\n<popey> dpm: did you see above, translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone-coreapps - I did terminal but it's still on the right, not on the left?\n<dpm> popey, that's probably because we don't have a po/ubuntu-terminal-app.pot file committed to the branch. It's relatively easy to get, but it takes a bit more work to document. I'll see if I can finish the documentation today\n<popey> ok, shall I setup the others?\n<dpm> popey, sure, it makes sense, if you want to, go for it!\n<popey> ok, will do\n<angel96_> gg\n<sathya> lk\n<sathya> ls\n<sathya> hey guys\n<ytuhejdj> is here a discoussion started?... or just finished?...\n<dpm> ytuhejdj, we're here to help everyone get started, so if you've got any questions or need any help just let us know\n<dpm> well, too late\n<victorp> dpm QTC seems broken in 12.04\n<victorp> I can enable ssh to the device\n<dpm> Mirv, any ideas about what could be going on with QtC on 12.04? ^^\n<dpm> popey, we're also not building the core apps packages for 12.04 in the daily PPA. Do you know whether there was any particular reason why we're not doing it? Shall we just enable 12.04 builds?\n<victorp> 12.04 is still the desktop that most people are sticking too outside Ubuntu contributos\n<victorp> we should make sure the SDK just works for 12.04\n<popey> dpm: we can try to test them on 12.04, for sure.\n * victorp thanks the touch terminal developer\n<victorp> :)\n<Mirv> dpm: I haven't tested, jppiiroinen may have (the latest Qt Creator precise upgrade was done during my vacation)\n<dpm> popey, yeah, I think it'd make sense to enable the 12.04 builds, as I've already seen 2 comments where people were asking for it. Do you want to have a look at enabling those builds, or do you want me to do it?\n<popey> for core apps we need to speak to fginther\n<popey> for collection we don't.\n<dpm> jppiiroinen, could you help victorp with his QtC issue on 12.04?\n<dpm> victorp, you mention SSH not working on QtC. Is that it, or do you have other issues with it?\n<victorp> dpm -  I have worked aroud it by installing ssh manually\n<victorp> dpm - enabling developer mode fails\n<dpm> oh actually\n<popey> interesting\n<dpm> I had the same problem on 13.04\n<dpm> I thought it was a glitch\n<jppiiroinen> hmm\n<popey> you get a log in qtcreator\n<dpm> and did the same as you\n<popey> be good to get that\n<popey> well, console output in a window\n<dpm> i.e. manual installation of openssh-server\n<jppiiroinen> i run precise myself here\n<dpm> popey, gotcha. Why do we need to talk to fginther? Because we need to add Jenkins jobs?\n<jppiiroinen> it would be interesting to see what happened, as if there was some temporary issue with package management etc on the device\n<dpm> jppiiroinen, next time it happens to me on 13.04 I'll report a bug. IIRC, the issue on the QtC connection log was that openssh-server could not be installed, so there wasn't much I could debug from that. But I think you're right in that it might point to a packaging management issue\n<popey> yes\n<popey> i have a clean precise VM, I could test qtcreator there (assuming it will see my phone over USB)\n * popey tests\n<jppiiroinen> doing the same here with my n7\n<popey> So my test plan is. Boot clean VM, follow qtcreator install instructions from developer.ubuntu.com, plug phone in, enable developer mode, right?\n<jppiiroinen> popey: im starting from phablet-flash\n<popey> ok, will do that too,\n<om26er> tmoenicke, so the real keyboard is nemo-keyboard package ?\n<om26er> I start the maliit-server from terminal and a transparent window appears on my desktop\n<popey> bah, virtualbox can't see my tablet\n * popey tries other things\n<tmoenicke> om26er: no. maliit-keyboard and maliit-keyboard-data\n<om26er> tmoenicke, so  I just figured and maliit-keyboard is not build for any other architecture than armhf\n<tmoenicke> om26er: yep\n<om26er> tmoenicke,  I build it on i386 and installed it. now maliit-server crashed with: open /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpinyin/data/pinyin_index.bin failed!\n<om26er> is there a way to build without pinyin support ?\n<tmoenicke> om26er: can you install libpinyin?\n<om26er> tmoenicke, yes its installed, but I think the maliit-keyboard is hardcoded to use libpinyin from the arm dir  ?\n<om26er> FWIW /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpinyin/data/pinyin_index.bin does exist. its just the maliit-server is looking in the wrong dir :/\n<denisw> hi, is there already calendar-app hacking going on? :)\n<thor_> hi again does any DatePicker component exist in the available components?\n<popey> hey denisw sure\n<denisw> unfortunately i don't have the time to help out currently (I have a bachelor thesis to write), but I hope this will change in the future\n<denisw> i'm very excited about a set of core apps directly from the ubuntu community, especially if they will scale to the desktop eventually\n<micah2> How much more do you have to go on your thesis?\n<denisw> i'll probably be done at the beginning of september\n<micah2> Cool, then you'll definitely have time to jump in before 14.04.\n<denisw> yeah, that would be great\n<denisw> are there any plans to make the apps desktop-ready in the 14.04 cycle?\n<denisw> (or rather, more pleasant on the desktop, given that they already run on standard ubuntu)\n<micah2> There's been recent work on the conditional layouts, so I'd imagine it will be possible.\n<denisw> cool. is there already already an app using conditional layouting, or has only infrastructure work been done for now?\n<WebbyIT> A question: when I propose a merge, have I to change the bug status in Fix Commited or have to leave In Progress?\n<micah2> I know today is about the Calendar, but I'm trying to get up and running with helping with the Music app. Anyone here who can bring me up to speed with the music app?\n<popey> WebbyIT: in progress until it lands, then it's fix committed/fix released\n<WebbyIT> popey: ok, thanks\n<jppiiroinen> popey: i was able to enable the developer mode on my workstation, i will do next a full bootstrap flashing\n<popey> jppiiroinen: still installing bits here, it's a precise install on a usb stick\n<jppiiroinen> dpm: the best tip for victorp is to remove the openssh-server manually and try to re-enable the developer mode\n<jppiiroinen> and also to make sure that he has the latest device image\n<dpm> popey, joining the music app call?\n<popey> ah\n<popey> i don't have hangout capability because my laptop is booted to precise on a usb stick\n<popey> can't install debs right now as it's mid install qtcreator and friends\n<popey> Mirv: jppiiroinen  ok, first issue after install sdk on a clean precise install... http://paste.ubuntu.com/5861669/\n<popey> looks like adb permissions issue\n<popey> ya, sudo adb works around it\n<popey> Mirv: jppiiroinen problem is /usr/share/qtcreator/scripts/device_search then kills the adb server and restarts as non-root\n<dpm> popey, no worries. I just talked to Daniel Holm about getting the scanning functionality in shape to get the music app in the default images and the hackfest.

It does indeed work like a flickable\n<nik90> kaleo: but at that time, we had some issues implementing the flickable. May be I should give it a try again\n<zeokila> mhall119, it's going to be (if I manage) an eBook reader, but I'm pretty much new to QML, and have no C++ experience (though I have knowlege in other languages) so I'm going to have quite a lot to learn, which is great, build and learn :D https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-read/\n<kaleo> nik90, definitely\n<kaleo> nik90, especially because the swipe behaviour is behaving oddly\n<nik90> kaleo: what do you mean by behaving oddly?\n<kaleo> nik90, it gets stuck\n<nik90> I had renato_ 's help in implementing it\n<mhall119> zeokila: nice!

But then the icon is the  same for ambiance and radiance themes, I'd like to distinguish between dark and light icon theme. How do I do that?\n<dpm> Mirv, I've got a bunch of Qt 4 packages installed on my 13.04 laptop. I'm not using them, so I'm wondering if you know of an easy way to remove them. Is there a metapackage that I can use to remove them app?\n<dpm> vl4kn0, can you not specify an absolute path in the icon path?\n<vl4kn0> dpm: yes I do that, I only specify icon-ubuntu in the icon path and then I can specify icon-theme-path, that's where I specify absolute path to the icon theme (directory where the icons are stored)\n<Mirv> dpm: libqtcore4 should help, assuming you don't have Qt apps. if just the dev stuff, maybe libqt4-dev would be enough\n<dpm> vl4kn0, can you paste your .desktop file somewhere? it might be easier to follow if someone can help you\n<caersith> Can i use the ubuntu-sdk on a vbox ubuntu guest machine? When I ran the code it only shows black screen. Could someone help me?\n<Mirv> dpm: well of course you have Qt4 apps, not just Qt5, so try the dev package\n<dpm> Mirv, I'll try that.

qtubuntu, let me mark it as such\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, found it\n<kaleo> https://bugs.launchpad.net/qtubuntu/+bug/1186556\n<ubot2`> Ubuntu bug 1186556 in qtubuntu \"Browser does not respond to Qt.openUrlExternally(link)\" [Undecided,Confirmed]\n<oSoMoN> yep, that one\n<oSoMoN> kaleo: how about adding a comment in the code to explain that the animations are not bezier splines because of a bug in Qt?\n<kaleo> seb128, question, do we have any standard place on the phone that says what is the default browser?\n<seb128> kaleo, not that I know about\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, hmm, I'm the only one who is going to want to put a bezier spline there :)\n<oSoMoN> kaleo: fair enough, ignore my suggestion then :)\n<kaleo> seb128, anything planned in that regard?\n<seb128> kaleo, not that I read about, but it's a good question\n<seb128> mpt, ^ do you know?\n<kaleo> seb128, ok\n<kaleo> seb128, we need qtubuntu to implement Qt.openUrlExternally but for that we need to know what browser to launch :)\n<oSoMoN> kaleo: the standard easing used to be a QEasingCurve::OutQuint before rev 600, and you now made it a QEasingCurve::OutQuad, is that intentional?\n<kaleo> seb128, cf bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/qtubuntu/+bug/1186556\n<ubot2`> Ubuntu bug 1186556 in qtubuntu \"Browser does not respond to Qt.openUrlExternally(link)\" [Critical,Confirmed]\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, yes\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, it's the closest to the bezier curve we had\n<oSoMoN> kaleo: ok\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, unfortunately it's not quite the same..\n<oSoMoN> kaleo: on est b\u00c3\u00a9zier\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, lol\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, mdr\n<seb128> kaleo, what about doing the same thing as on the desktop?\n<kaleo> seb128, why not\n<seb128> kaleo, use the default handle for x-scheme-handler/http\n<seb128> handler*\n<kaleo> seb128, right but where do we have that information?\n<kaleo> seb128, I mean, where do we store the default handlers\n<seb128> kaleo, /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n<seb128> well those are for mimetypes\n<seb128> kaleo, you mean when you change it?\n<oSoMoN> kaleo, seb128:\u00c2\u00a0the desktop file of webbrowser-app has a MimeType entry, fwiw\n<kaleo> seb128, nice\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, nice\n<kaleo> seb128, do you know if there is any lib or anything that accesses  /usr/share/applications/defaults.list ?\n<oSoMoN> kaleo: approved, feel free to top-approve once CI has run\n<seb128> kaleo, the fdo spec is http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mime-actions-spec/ ... let me have a look\n<kaleo> oSoMoN, thx\n<kaleo> seb128, thanks, putting that in the bug report\n<oSoMoN> WebbyIT: could you please also update the commit message of the MR to something more descriptive of what it actually does?\n<dpm> popey, mhall119 \"- Initial click packages for all community core apps have been created and added to Jenkins, next step is to land on the image.\" <- oh, that's pretty cool, I hadn't noticed that

https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/msg02746.html\n<kaleo> holy shit\n<kaleo> dpm, amazing\n<dpm> yeah :)\n<kaleo> bfiller, you rock\n<bfiller> kaleo: what did I do?\n<kaleo> bfiller, 3G\n<kaleo> bfiller, and on/off\n<bfiller> kaleo: just the messenger :) renato and cyphermox deserve the credit\n<kaleo> renato, cyphermox: bravo\n<seb128> kaleo, http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtgui/qdesktopservices.html ... seems that does what you want?\n<kaleo> seb128, well no\n<kaleo> seb128, this very likely relies on the platform plugin\n<kaleo> seb128, in our case, qtubuntu\n<kaleo> seb128, oh, but you are giving me an idea!\n<kaleo> seb128, the platform plugin on the desktop does the right thing\n<kaleo> seb128, we can just use that\n<seb128> right ;-)\n<kaleo> seb128, or part of that\n<kaleo> seb128, cause launching apps is done differently\n<kaleo> seb128, ahah, it uses xdg-open on the desktop\n<seb128> kaleo, ah, that makes sense ... in any case I think gtk&co copy the fdo code from http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdgmime to do the mime parsing work\n<seb128> kaleo, so if qt doesn't do it for you I guess you should use that in qtubuntu\n<kaleo> seb128, well, it's not really cool to use a perl script\n<kaleo> seb128, I put my recommendation in the bug report in the end\n<seb128> kaleo, right, I don't like xdg-open/don't say it's a good solution, but I'm not surprised it's being used there, most desktop have been doing that\n<kaleo> seb128, yep\n<kaleo> seb128, so in essence I think the fix is simple\n<seb128> kaleo, question for you ... do you have any pointer to documentation/code showing how to display a spinner on screen or something in qml while things are loading?\n<kaleo> seb128, spinner is the ActivityIndicator\n<kaleo> seb128, in the toolkit\n<kaleo> seb128, however, what's your design?\n<seb128> in fact I've a simple app\n<seb128> with a\n<seb128> Text { text: backend.data }\n<kaleo> (http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/devel/ubuntu-13.10/qml/ui-toolkit/qml-ubuntu-components0-activityindicator.html)\n<kaleo> seb128, I mean what's the app, what's the design, who's the designer?\n<seb128> where backend.data is 30Mb or text read from disk and returned in a buffer\n<seb128> my app hangs while the backend reads/return the datas and those are rendered\n<seb128> kaleo, I don't have a design for the \"what to do while it loads\"\n<kaleo> seb128, get one :)\n<seb128> kaleo, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AboutThisDevice#Phone\n<seb128> kaleo, it's the \"Software Licenses\"\n<kaleo> seb128, also if you know the progress, you can use a ProgressBar\n<seb128> which is basically \"dump /usr/share/doc/*/copyright\"\n<kaleo> seb128, one clue: nobody is going to read 30Mb of text\n<kaleo> seb128, so something's wrong :)\n<seb128> kaleo, yeah, it's legal obligation\n<seb128> android does the same\n<seb128> I looked on my phone\n<kaleo> seb128, they have books of text in one page?\n<seb128> they have a screen taking 15s to load\n<kaleo> jesus\n<seb128> with endless content\n<kaleo> seb128, I hope you are not blocking the device while doing that\n<kaleo> seb128, I also hope the rendering of Text {} is done smartly\n<seb128> kaleo, well, for now I'm not doing anything, I'm working on that, it's not commited yet\n<kaleo> seb128, :)\n<seb128> no, atm it's not :p\n<seb128> I just started\n<kaleo> seb128, so, you need the designer's input\n<seb128> I've a dumb cpp function going over the files and filling a buffer\n<kaleo> seb128, but you have ActivityIndicator and ProgressBar at your disposab\n<kaleo> disposal\n<seb128> ok\n<seb128> I guess I need to do progressive data filing somewhat\n<seb128> my current approch is file a buffer and return it when done\n<kaleo> seb128, there are some facilities in Qt for that I think\n<seb128> but that's not going to work for progressive stuff\n<kaleo> seb128, can't remember\n<WebbyIT> oSoMoN: done\n<seb128> do I need threads?\n<seb128> kaleo, I'm pondering just doing the stupid stuff, nobody is ever going to be interested in that dialog, it's just there to be compliant with the copyright/licenses\n<seb128> :p\n<kaleo> seb128, yes, but you don't want to block nonetheless :)\n<seb128> kaleo, even android does it in a stupid way\n<kaleo> seb128, check around http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qfile.html\n<kaleo> seb128, if there is nothing that does it progressively then threads are an option\n<kaleo> seb128, for which you have good facilities in Qt too\n<seb128> kaleo, ok, thanks\n<oSoMoN> WebbyIT: well done, approved\n<WebbyIT> oSoMoN: thank for your patience!\n<oSoMoN> yw\n<WebbyIT> oSoMoN: before the merge do you want that I set the default value of endTime to startTime + 1h?\n<oSoMoN> WebbyIT: nah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ok, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do it separately (and get input from design on it)\n<WebbyIT> oSoMoN: ok, thanks

I've done this by moving the db writes into a single transactions. Not sure how useful this is as the UI still freezes while scanning the dirs but it is much faster at building the database :)\n<popey> oh nice\n<popey> mhall119: diverged branches \u00e2\u0098\u00b9\n<popey> i forgot to pull first\n<danielholm> ahayzen: thats awesome\n<ahayzen> danielholm, the only thing it is missing is any error handling in the db writes, but is that taken into account at the moment any way?\n<jono> ahayzen, awesome :-)\n<mhall119> popey: bzr rebase :)\n<mhall119> ahayzen: wow, do you have that in a bzr branch on Launchpad?  I'd love to try it\n<ahayzen> I can push up if u want, is very hacky though ;)\n<mhall119> ahayzen: that's fine\n<danielholm> ahayzen: I dont think so, no.\n<popey> i did bzr merge, and it found one conflict...\n<danielholm> ahayzen: please push it :)\n<popey> bah\n<ahayzen> mhall119, where do i push to?\n<danielholm> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17604688/delegate-an-array-in-qml\n<ahayzen> mhall119, ah its called music-app .. got it :)\n<popey> mhall119: think i fixed it \u00e2\u0098\u00bb\n<ahayzen> danielholm, https://code.launchpad.net/~andrew-hayzen/music-app/database-write-single-transaction\n<danielholm> ahayzen: lovely!\n<popey> sweet! thanks ahayzen\n * ahayzen hopes it works\n<popey> music app hack day success!\n<ahayzen> woo\n<ahayzen> and 15mins left :)\n<popey> hah\n<danielholm> indeed!\n<popey> 1 hour 15 if you go by utc \u00e3\u008b\u009b\n<ahayzen> heh\n<popey> get back to work!\n<jono> ahayzen, testing now\n<jono> I have 95GB music so keen to see how much faster this is\n * ahayzen (yn)\n<ahayzen> blimey\n<ahayzen> i have 20GB and its loading in ~7-8 secs with a 1651 change count\n<jono> ahayzen, I started up both branches at the same time\n<jono> they are both processing now\n<ahayzen> yeah the UI still freezes :/ but the writing to the DB is very fast...before for me it sat for 60s+ writing to the disk\n<jono> ahayzen, cool\n<jono> ahayzen, I filed a bug about the UI freezing\n<jono> https://bugs.launchpad.net/music-app/+bug/1200368\n<ubot2`> Ubuntu bug 1200368 in Ubuntu Music App \"UI blocks when scanning in music\" [High,Confirmed]\n<ahayzen> i tried to figure out how to solve the UI..\n<ahayzen> yh saw tht, tht was where i started :) but ended up making this change\n<jono> :-)\n<jono> I am not sure how QML handles async\n<ahayzen> looked into WorkerScript to run in background thread but u can't pass Qt objects through :( (or u could before but not anymore :/)\n<ahayzen> jono, was it any faster? or are they still processing?\n<jono> ahayzen, still going\n<ahayzen> at the UI stage?\n<jono> I am running two clients, so both will be slower, but the difference should be clear\n<jono> still sucking in ~/Music\n<ahayzen> did urs take forever to write the DB aswell after the UI has finished?\n<jono> ahayzen, looks like the DB portion is running now- I see a lot of terminal output\n<jono> ahayzen, ok, you branch now showing UI\n<jono> at 4pm my time\n<ahayzen> awesome ... midnight :)\n<jono> now the other branch will be running full steam\n<jono> so it is not a completely fair test\n<jono> it seems to be still sucking in music and not at the DB write part yet\n<ahayzen> it finds a file then adds to db then goes to the next...whereas mine finds all the files puts in a buffer then writes them all\n<jono> now it is complete at 4.02\n<jono> it is definitely faster :-)\n<ahayzen> :)\n<jono> I am sure danielholm will take a look soon and then merge\n<jono> nice work ahayzen :-)\n<ahayzen> jono, thx... first thing i've ever done with QML/JS :)\n<jono> ahayzen, nice :-)\n<jono> thanks for helping the core apps, we really appreciate the help\n<jono> to get them dogfoodable this month will be awesome :-)\n<danielholm> I will! it already looks promising.

I would like to change the visual of the ListItem. (font size, icon size)\n<kaleo> renato, don't\n<kaleo> renato, it should probably part of the toolkit\n<kaleo> renato, what's the design you need to implement?\n<kaleo> renato, what's missing?\n<renato> kaleo, the list item on contact list has different font size and icon size\n<kaleo> renato, show me\n<kaleo> renato, (we always need to check with the designers if the difference between the design of the app and the sdk are meant to be or just a mistake)\n<kaleo> renato, (a mistake in the design or a mistake in the sdk)\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2013-07-12\n<mhall119> nik90: thanks for the email, this will certainly help folks tomorrow\n<dholbach> good morning\n<Aviral> is there any command to exit from the application  on user click?\n<AlanBell> what is the package to install to get the new ubuntu SDK stuff and Qt Designer?\n<Aviral> AlanBell: http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/\n<AlanBell> hmm, I thought it had landed in the 13.10 repos yesterday or something?\n<AlanBell> the thing this article is about http://iloveubuntu.net/qt-creator-271-renamed-ubuntu-sdk-available-ubuntu-1310-numerous-new-features\n<AlanBell> qt creator is different to Qt designer it seems, maybe that is where I was going wrong\n<Aviral> now it is working or not?\n<AlanBell> I think there is some other package that installs plugins to QtCreator for Ubuntu development\n<AlanBell> apparently it is findable in software centre, but that takes ages to start and crashes as soon as it does start\n<Aviral> u are running ubuntu sdk and now it is crashing\n<dpm> AlanBell, the way we recommend to install the SDK is with http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/ - if there is another way that doesn't work, would you mind reporting it against https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-ui-toolkit ?\n<Aviral> tried this command?? sudo add-apt-repository ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-proper && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk\n<AlanBell> no, software centre crashes, not the sdk\n<dpm> ah, I see\n<dpm> then in that case, the bug is in SC :)\n<AlanBell> so what landed in 13.10?\n<dpm> AlanBell, Qt Designer is not a standalone app: there is only Qt Creator and Qt Creator with Ubuntu plugins. Both contain the Qt Designer as a tab (i.e. as part of Qt Creator)\n<dpm> perhaps you've got an old Qt Designer package from Qt 4?\n<dpm> AlanBell, what landed on 13.10 archive and on the 13.04 & older  PPAs was a change to be able to: invoke Qt Creator with the Ubuntu plugins by typing \"ubuntu sdk\" on the dash or invoke vanilla Qt Creator by typing \"qt creator\" on the Dash\n<AlanBell> probably, yeah, it was qt4-designer I was looking at\n<AlanBell> typing \"ubuntu sdk\" on the dash tries to sell me books about hacking the Kinect\n<AlanBell> do I need that ppa on 13.10 still?\n<dpm> AlanBell, that works fine for me, but I'm using the PPAs I've just been pointed at bug 1198084, which might be relevant here.\n<ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1198084 in qtcreator-ubuntu \"Unity Dash doesn't recognize Ubuntu SDK as an installable app\" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1198084\n<AlanBell> ah, ubuntu-sdk is the package, which isn't installable at the moment it seems\n<dpm> AlanBell, we're in the process of updating the SDK installation instructions to recommend just the ubuntu-sdk package from the archive in saucy (i.e. no PPAs). So it could come in quite handy if you try to basically forget about the PPA and report back if you've got any glitches\n<nik90> dpm: In the http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/, you should remove the wording \"Development release\" since 13.10 does not require any ppa to get the latest sdk or qt packages\n<AlanBell> yeah, I think I still have some ppa cruft from before my upgrade, libqt5v8-5 is 5.0.2-3ubuntu1~raring1~test1\n<nik90> dpm: updated packages land in the archive directly. This will also be the case when we transistion to 14.04 later\n<JamesTait> Good morning all, happy Friday and happy Cow Appreciation Day! (With a shout out to Embrace Your Geekness Day tomorrow) :-D\n<nik90> AlanBell: that's right. I had similar issues as well.\n<AlanBell> as the archive packages are not a higher version than the raring ppa I need to downgrade those things\n<nik90> oh btw morning all :-)\n<dpm> hi nik90, good morning! :-) that's what we're trying to do, but some steps need to be done to ensure the transition is smooth. Not all packages land as part of daily releases yet (e.g. Qt Creator) -> http://pad.ubuntu.com/GjiQAlduX5\n<AlanBell> which collapses quite a big dependency tree, so I might leave that until later\n<nik90> dpm: kaleo asked me to remove all the ppa which I did.\n<dpm> nik90, ah, you're the perfect testing candidate, then :) Did you run into any issues or glitches?\n<nik90> dpm: I removed the ppa only 2 days ago. For now I do not see any issues. However I wouldnt know myself since I do not what the latest version of these packages are in the ppa and if I received as normal updates.\n<Aviral> nik90: is there any command to exit from the application on user choice ex i will create a button of exit\n<mpt> kaleo, seb128: There is no default browser setting in System Settings. It hadn't occurred to me that we'd have more than one. :-)\n<Aviral> dpm: is there any command to exit from the application on user choice ex i will create a button of exit\n<seb128> mpt, hey, we will probably not have > 1 at the start, but no other OS is getting away with that ... ;-)\n<nik90> Aviral: currentyly none of the applications have an exit button\n<nik90> Aviral: you have to use HUD to quit the application\n<Aviral> nik90: ya thats why i am asking\n<dpm> mpt, do you have any input on bug 1198084 ? I'm not sure if it's related to SC/aptdaemon or rather to the applications scope\n<ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1198084 in qtcreator-ubuntu \"Unity Dash doesn't recognize Ubuntu SDK as an installable app\" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1198084\n<nik90> This cannot be done localised to the clock app. It is something which will be common to all applications and hence should automatically come from the sdk\n<nik90> or rather *shouldnt* be done localised in the clock app.\n<Aviral> oh so there is no need to implement the exit option?\n<mpt> dpm, no, no idea sorry.\n<dpm> no worries. Saviq, would you have a clue on that bug? ^^\n<dpm> Aviral, no need to for now, that's correct. You can close the apps on the app scope by long-pressing on them already\n<Aviral> actually i am working on simple animal farm app and it shows a blank action bar so is there any way that it dosent appear even when the user scroll down to up\n<Aviral> dpm:  thanks :)\n<Saviq> dpm, not sure, but I'd expect the software center parses for .desktop files and such\n<Saviq> dpm, but I don't have experience with it either\n<dpm> Aviral, there is already an animal farm app, perhaps you want to join forces with Robert Ancell? -> https://plus.google.com/106527694663794732344/posts/LuFPbQXN8dT\n<nik90> Aviral: if you have no toolbar options, then the toolbar should not popup when you swipe from bottom to top\n<Aviral> ya i knw i am working on that only :)\n<nik90> the toolbar should in essence be disabled\n<Aviral> there is no toolbar option it is still showing pop up\n<dpm> Saviq, yeah, we have a .desktop file for that already. No worries, I'll try to find out more. mpt, one last question: do you know who the best person to ask about that bug on the Software Center side be?\n<nik90> you might want to report a bug against the sdk regarding this then\n<Aviral> need to asign a bug for SDK??\n<nik90> yes\n<AskUbuntu> not be written in the urlentry of an application made \u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008bin glade, how to enable?

But I do not think it is recommended to put multi-line text in it\n<nik90> timp: I was not able to use ListItem.Standard since it does not allow me to change the text size. So I used ListItem.Base to add a label to it.\n<WebbyIT> nik90: I've no phone, but on computer is definitely too big for my taste\n<WebbyIT> dpm: thanks :)\n<timp> nik90: I'm not sure what you want to accomplish exactly. Do you have a visual design of what you want?\n<timp> nik90: yes for custom list items that may be what you need.\n<nik90> timp: yes, let me share it. 1 second\n<timp> nik90: but on the other hand, if you can use Standard that is better because it is consistent among apps\n<timp> nik90: and if the default we use there is wrong for all apps we should change it in the UITK\n<nik90> timp: http://ubuntuone.com/35fEbdT2KpA0bE0fc4C69b\n<nik90> timp: I am not sure if the fonts we received from design apply to all the other apps.

I actually got an email from a contributor wanted to test core apps, however he couldn't even install certain core apps like calendar or weather I think because he was running 12.04\n<popey> That's a real shame.\n<kaleo> nik90, you won't need to set the theme manually anymore to have the gradient working\n<nik90> kaleo: ok\n<nik90> kaleo: I have been replacing my colors also with Theme.palette stuff\n<WebbyIT> oSoMoN: about MR of yesterday, I don't understand why Jenkins wants a new review\n<WebbyIT> https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-calendar-app/1193090/+merge/170957\n<oSoMoN> WebbyIT: let me check\n<kaleo> nik90, and it will be in lp:ubuntu-ui-toolkit (trunk) in 30 mintues\n<kaleo> minutes*\n<WebbyIT> kaleo: great job :)\n<nik90> kaleo: but it will land only as an update once jenkins releases a new UITK update?\n<kaleo> WebbyIT, thx\n<kaleo> nik90, you mean land in the touch image?\n<nik90> kaleo: no I mean as an update to saucy desktop through the update manager\n<kaleo> nik90, right, it could take a while\n<kaleo> nik90, today very probably\n<kaleo> nik90, worst case, tomorrow\n<oSoMoN> WebbyIT: it looks like it failed for no good reason (sometimes jenkins is a bit flaky), I re-approved it, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see if it lands correctly this time\n<nik90> kaleo: thnx for all this. the theming infrastructure is so much better now\n<kaleo> nik90, but packages are available in the MR already\n<kaleo> nik90, yw :)\n<WebbyIT> oSoMoN: ok, thanks :)\n<nik90> kaleo: ah ok. Will give it a shot\n<WebbyIT> is it possible to use setTimeout? Because I insert it in a function in a .qml file but doesn't work!\n<salem_> om26er, ping\n<om26er> salem_, pong\n<salem_> om26er, hey, about ofono, I just dist-upgraded here and I got the same behavior, but I restarted it by hand and it then it works.\n<om26er> salem_, restarted = server restart ofono ?\n<salem_> om26er, yes\n<om26er> *service\n<salem_> om26er, I wonder if ofono is not being started before dbus\n<om26er> salem_, i have done that a number of times\n<salem_> om26er, did you use service restart? or stop/start?\n<om26er> salem_, i cannot find ofono in system bus at all\n<om26er> salem_, both\n<salem_> om26er, ok, I am rebooting my system and then I can confirm. just a sec\n<om26er> salem_, ack\n<dpm> WebbyIT, oSoMoN, the reason that merge proposal was rejected by Jenkins was because now it only lands branches that pass all the autopilot tests\n<dpm> https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-calendar-app/1193090/+merge/170957\n<dpm> clicking on the link on the latest comment brings me to http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/ubuntu-calendar-app-autolanding/5/artifact/generic-mediumtests/test_results.xml\n<dpm> where it says it's not passing these two tests:\n<dpm> - test_timeline_view_shows(with mouse)\n<dpm> - test_new_event(with mouse)\n<oSoMoN> dpm: actually, it says that those two tests (the only tests the app has) are passing\n<oSoMoN> dpm: see \"errors=0\" and \"failures=0\"\n<dpm> oSoMoN, ah, you're right, I misread \"failures\"\n<dpm> ignore my comment, then :)\n<dpm> balloons, any idea why that merge proposal is failing? ^^\n<nik90> dpm: oSomon previously said that jenkins was being flaky..we should see if it passes the next time. At the moment however the jenkins bot is down. I notified fginther who confirmed it. He should bring it up online soon.\n<nik90> Does anybody here know which app I can use to browse gsetting keys..I cant remember the one I used to use before.\n<dpm> nik90, I believe dconf-editor\n<nik90> Ian Lane has written a nice sample app to browser the wallpaper using gsettings keys and I want to see If I can use it get the current time format using gsettings\n<nik90> dpm: ah that is it. Cant believe I forgot the app's name.\n<dpm> nik90, unfortunately, just before Laney created the app, I learnt that we're not yet in a position to recommend GSettings to app developers\n<nik90> dpm: oh :(\n<Laney> OH!\n<dpm> it's because it's not in scope for app confinement in 13.10 apparently\n<dpm> one of the security guys pinged me about it after I filed the bug to get API documentation for it\n<nik90> that's too bad. I am guessing they are building some other system to provide that funtionality while still confining to app confinement?\n<om26er> salem_, hey, its seems to be a blunder on my end :/\n<om26er> salem_, I had the wrong version of ofono installed, (from the phablet-team ppa)\n<dpm> nik90, not really, we don't have a fallback yet, so it's back to using LocalStorage and sqlite\n<nik90> dpm: for the clock app I was more interested in reading gsettings keys than for writing into it\n<nik90> the gsetting keys provide info such as the time format 12/24 hour format. I thought of using that to show the correct format\n<dpm> Laney, I'll forward you the thread. In any case, your sample app will make for a good tutorial on d.u.c when GSettings is included in the app confinement work\n<Laney> What happens if you try to use it?\n<Laney> We're already using it in system-settings ...\n<nik90> actually yes I was sure that the system-settings app was using it\n<dpm> nik90, I'd recommend checking with seb128, kenvandine or the security guys, let me give you their nicks in a sec\n<nik90> Laney: Since it is the system settings app, does it need app confinement?\n<Laney> don't really know about that\n<nik90> Laney: btw thanks for the app code. I couldn't find anywhere a good example of a flickable. I can learn from your code :-)\n<Laney> nik90: Anyway, it's not too useful on the device since AFAIK nothing sets the gsettings stuff so at best you get the defaults\n<Laney> it's good on desktop though\n<kenvandine> i don't think system-settings will be in app confinement\n<kenvandine> some of the plugins will need access to things like that\n<nik90> kenvandine: true.\n<salem_> om26er, yes, I rebooted here and it worked out of the box.\n<Laney> it's too bad if apps won't be able to use gsettings at all\n<om26er> salem_, yeah, the problem was on my end, using wrong ofono\n<kenvandine> maybe long term it could be, but we would need more rules for allowing it to do what it needs\n<salem_> om26er, ok, better then!\n<kenvandine> Laney, we're discussing it\n<nik90> Laney: yes. but we cannot really write qml apps just for the desktop anyway, so yeah\n<kenvandine> Laney, how confined apps can use gsettings-qt\n<kenvandine> specifically each app would get their own confined settings\n<kenvandine> but not sure it is doable for 13.10\n<Laney> hmm\n<kenvandine> Laney, one thing that it would need to support is multiple installs of the same app\n<kenvandine> with different settings\n<kenvandine> i guess that is a supported scenario\n<mrqtros> Hi all :)\n<kenvandine> so i guess relocatable schemas\n<kenvandine> hi mrqtros\n<nik90> mrqtros: hi\n<ayr_ton> Today still the Music App Hackday?\n<popey> clock!\n<popey> music was yesterday, but we accept patches every day!\n<mhall119> popey: nik90: how is the hack day going?\n<popey> mhall119: nik90 has been active here..\n<popey> https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-clock-app/1197436/+merge/174380\n<nik90> mhall119: hi\n<nik90> mhall119: well we had our first commit by WebbyIT\n<nik90> ckpringle: Can you take a look at https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1171470, it was submitted by you during the clock wireframe design implementation. Things have changed quite a bit since then and we have removed the millisecond transition. In essence the bug is fixed.\n<dpm> hey mrqtros, careful if you say hi here, we might recruit you for the clock app as well ;)\n<ubot2`> Ubuntu bug 1171470 in Ubuntu UX \"[clock app] Stopwatch milliseconds to seconds transition feels strange \" [High,Triaged]\n<nik90> ckpringle: I still like to get it by you before I mark it fixed.\n<mrqtros> dpm Ahah ))))\n<nik90> dpm: :-)\n<mhall119> nik90: well, first commit to Clock by WebbyIT, he's been submitting ot other apps all week\n<ckpringle> nik90:  done\n<nik90> mrqtros: feel free to take a loot at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-clock-app/+bugs?field.tag=hackday\n<nik90> mhall119: yes I noticed. Our hack day specialist WebbyIT\n<nik90> ckpringle: thnx\n<nik90> mhall119: the background gradient support by kaleo has landed in trunk. Eagerly waiting on update to saucy :D\n<kaleo> nik90, mhall119: API is SO COMPLEX :)\n<nik90> kaleo: :), oh btw any colors used should be through Theme.palette and not UbuntuColors right?\n<mhall119> what?\n<kaleo> nik90, correct\n<nik90> mhall119: ?\n<balloons> sorry I've gotten dc'd so many times this morning, my IRC client is confused ;-) I thought I'd pop in here and manually see what's up.. looks like there is a backlog of some questions\n<seb128> kaleo, nik90: what Theme.palette?\n<seb128> kaleo, nik90: is using  UbuntuColors.orange wrong?\n<balloons> so popey autopilot requires newer stuff that is only found in raring or greater. Some thought was given towards having it work in precise, but you know, the sdk stuff doesn't work there either, so ...\n<balloons> dpm, you have/had a question on merge requests?\n<nik90> seb128: yes using UbuntuColors is incorrect\n<dpm> balloons, the sdk does work on 12.04\n<seb128> nik90, why and what should I use instead?\n<balloons> daker, oO?\n<nik90> seb128: basically if use UbuntuColors, then irrespective of the system theme, the color will be what you set it. Instead it should take whatever the theme suggests.\n<nik90> seb128: So you should be using the SDK theme palette. Let me grab the documentation for you.\n<seb128> hum\n<dpm> balloons, yeah, I did have a question, thanks for coming back to me. It seems this merge proposal got rejected for no apparent reason: https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-calendar-app/1193090/+merge/170957\n<seb128> nik90, the Ubuntu's orange is not theme specific though\n<dpm> We were wondering if you might have an idea why\n<nik90> seb128: true. What I meant was that you shouldn't hardcode the widget's color by using UbuntuColors.\n<mhall119> seb128: nik90: I'm assuming the two APIs serve different use cases\n<nik90> Instead you should let the theme provide the color\n<balloons> dpm, sure let's see why\n<dpm> thanks :)\n<nik90> mhall119: yes\n<kaleo> seb128, the ubuntu's orange is only used in specific themes\n<kaleo> seb128, what's your use case?\n<balloons> dpm, ohh I see why I think right off the bat :-)\n<nik90> seb128: If you open the UITK gallery and then open the API documentation, there in the homepage you should find Theme palette documentation.\n<seb128> kaleo, I'm using it in the disk space bar to show the space taken by the ubuntu image\n<seb128> in system settings\n<balloons> yea, indeed.. the UI for calendar has changed but the autopilot test hasn't been updated.. it's failing now\n<kaleo> seb128, let me look\n<seb128> kaleo, well, it's easy to change if wanted\n<kaleo> seb128, oh yeah\n<nik90> kaleo: http://iloveubuntu.net/pictures_me/system%20settings%20dropdown%20filter%201.png\n<kaleo> seb128, nice custom widget\n<kaleo> seb128, hmmm, interesting\n<seb128> kaleo, thanks ;-)\n<dpm> balloons, I initially thought so too, but then I was pointed at \"errors=0\" and \"failures=0\" - so it seems either the tests passed or Jenkins does not report correctly\n<kaleo> seb128, yes right, it's \"Used by Ubuntu\"\n<balloons> dpm, yes jenkins is lying to you a bit\n<ayr_ton> Wait... I opened the ubuntu-clock-app and when I use the alt+tab the icon and name is from the Sudoku app. Is this normal?\n<kaleo> seb128, you have it right then\n<balloons> http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/generic-mediumtests/67/testReport/calendar_app.tests.test_calendar/\n<seb128> kaleo, right, thanks\n<kaleo> seb128, is this app supposed to use the light theme by default?\n<balloons> anyways, fix the ap test and you should be good.. need help?\n<kaleo> seb128, or is it going to switch to a different background color essentially?\n<mhall119> ayr_ton: yes, it's a limitation in qmlscene and unity 7\n<seb128> kaleo, that's a good question, I don't know\n<seb128> mpt, ^ do you know? ;-)\n<dpm> balloons, I think WebbyIT might need some help in fixing the tests for that merge request\n<mhall119> ayr_ton: basically because they all use qmlscene as the process, bamf can't tell what application the window really belongs to\n<balloons> dpm, ok, can do\n<kaleo> seb128, do you have any visual design mockups btw?\n<ayr_ton> mhall119, interesting, thanks :)\n<seb128> kaleo, no, no recent one at least ... just http://design.canonical.com/wp-content/uploads/phone-overview-visual.small_.png which is what was posted on the design blog some time ago\n<seb128> but that doesn't include subpanels\n<dpm> balloons, do you think you could also send a reminder to the ubuntu-touch-coreapps mailing list about autopilot tests being executed by Jenkins from now on? I know you mentioned it in the IRC meetings, but not all developers attend them, and probably not all of them are aware of this and might be puzzled by the sudden failures and Jenkins reporting \"0 errors\"\n<balloons> dpm, sure sounds like a fine idea\n<dpm> thanks balloons!\n<mpt> seb128, I've been given draft mockups that use the dark theme\n<jono> mhall119, dpm has the gradient support now landed?\n<mpt> Need to work over them with the visual designer\n<dpm> jono, kaleo tells us it's landing today\n<jono> dpm, perfect\n<nik90> jono: it has landed in trunk\n<jono> and then I guess we can work to get them implemented in the core apps\n<jono> nik90, awesome :-)\n<dpm> there you go :)\n<seb128> mpt, ok, can you share that with me, when you get things in an useful state?\n<jono> nik90, great work btw!\n<nik90> jono, dpm: waiting for it as an update in saucy\n<nik90> jono: thnx :)\n<jono> nik90, I used the clock the other day to time the flank steak I was grilling\n<jono> worked great :-)\n<nik90> jono: It is basically 3 lines of code to implement background gradients. All core apps should implement them quickly\n<jono> nik90, awesome :-)\n<nik90> I am glad.\n<kaleo> mhall119, ayr_ton: Trevinho is fixing that I believe, there is a bug report\n<oSoMoN> bfiller: this is the MR that groups history entries by domain name: https://code.launchpad.net/~osomon/webbrowser-app/domain-name/+merge/174435\n<bfiller> oSoMoN: cool will try it\n<kaleo> jono, dpm, it has landed\n<kaleo> (in trunk)\n<jono> kaleo, awesome :-)\n<kaleo> jono, oh, nik90 told you :)\n<jono> kaleo, :-)\n<nik90> kaleo: too late :)\n<mhall119> kaleo: good to hear, fixing it where?\n<jono> kaleo, any idea when it will be published so our core app devs can use it?\n<kaleo> mhall119, in BAMF\n<dpm> yeah, nice work kaleo ;)\n<kaleo> jono, today or tomorrow\n<jono> kaleo, perfect\n<jono> kaleo, btw, the theming changes in the toolkit look incredible\n<jono> they look so slick\n<mhall119> jono: only the clock and calculator have been given gradients in their visual designs\n<dpm> jono, it's part of the daily releases on saucy, so as Florian says, as soon as the builders pick it up from trunk\n<kaleo> jono, I know, rosie did an awesome job!\n<jono> dpm, ahh daily SDK releases are now up and running?\n<jono> awesome\n<ayr_ton> kaleo, for Unity 7 or Unity 8 only?\n<jono> mhall119, cool\n<kaleo> jono, it really changes the way you feel about the apps\n<mhall119> jono: btw, the screenshot of the Clock app on my blog, that's using the new API :)\n<kaleo> jono, we had daily releases for months actually :)\n<kaleo> jono, (just not of the documentation publication)\n<dpm> jono, for the SDK daily releases are up and running (except for Qt Creator)\n<mpt> seb128, sure thing\n<kaleo> mhall119, LINK\n<mhall119> ayr_ton: presumably Unity 8 won't need the fix, since it doesn't need BAMF\n<mpt> seb128, I'll put them on the relevant wiki pages\n<jono> mhall119, calendar has some gradients too\n<seb128> mpt, thanks\n<mhall119> kaleo: http://mhall119.com/2013/07/ubuntu-clock-app-hackfest/\n<jono> kaleo, really? I was updating in saucy and never saw updates\n<jono> odd\n<ayr_ton> mhall119, make sense\n<kaleo> seb128, ok, dark it will be then\n<jono> kaleo, ok, so I can unsubscribe from the PPA now I guess?\n<seb128> kaleo, seems so\n<kaleo> seb128, it will be good to have the visual designer's opinion on this widget then\n<mhall119> jono: calendar's visual designs aren't done yet, but they'll probably use gradients too, yes\n<kaleo> jono, yeah that's the thing\n<kaleo> jono, the PPA was probably preventing upgrades\n<kaleo> jono, remove it :)\n<jono> mhall119, basing it on http://design.canonical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013-06-20-15.28.21.jpg\n<jono> kaleo, awesome, removing now :-)\n<seb128> kaleo, yeah, that's a good point, I've been focussing more on getting the infos to the UI so far than on the UI details, it's time I work a bit more closely from the visual design guys\n<kaleo> seb128, it's what sells :)\n<seb128> mpt, ^ do you know if I should get in touch directly from somebody from design for the system settings visuals?\n<mhall119> jono: from that blog post: \"The visuals in the image below are an exploration of how this can potentially look and feel. This is still very much still in progress, but gives a strong hint of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come.\"\n<mhall119> http://design.canonical.com/2013/06/solving-multiple-calendar-views/\n<mhall119> so it will likely use gradients, but we don't know yet where or how\n<nik90> seb128: I actually wanted to ask you. Is it possible for the system settings to change the system time as of now?\n<mpt> seb128, no, I'll publish them when they're ready\n<seb128> mpt, ok\n<mhall119> nik90: not last time I checked it\n<seb128> nik90, no, we don't have the datetime panel yet\n<kaleo> seb128, can system settings make me coffee?\n<nik90> seb128, mhall119: ok\n<seb128> kaleo, if you run it under sudo maybe :p\n<nik90> seb128: but I suppose you will take the system time from the gsettings then.\n<mhall119> kaleo: yes, but it's Americano\n<kaleo> :D\n<seb128> nik90, no, that doesn't make sense ... gsettings is for settings\n<mhall119> nik90: you should be able to just use the Qt time, and that will change based on system time\n<seb128> right, qt probably provides an api for that\n<nik90> mhall119: oh yeah.\n<seb128> nik90, you can \"text: Date()\"\n<seb128> standard js seems to work\n<seb128> (I just tried)\n<nik90> mhall119: me and popey were discussing on this in the design meeting where if the user sets a world city as his current location and if the system changes the time, then which one has precedence\n * mhall119 is always surprised when javascript works\n<mhall119> nik90: you should get UTC time from the system, then apply the world city's offset\n<WebbyIT> I'm sorry, I was away. I saw a ping by balloons and dpm about the MR, but i don't understand\n<mhall119> nik90: starting from UTC makes things easier most of the time\n<nik90> mhall119: I agree. However there is a special case not met by that logic which is should the world city's offset be ignored if the user's system time has been changed outside the clock app.\n<popey> mhall119: its not where you get the time from, the discussion was about how we adjust what we display\n<popey> e.g. you step off a plane in a new timezone, network updates time, the clock should take account of that, but still let the user override it\n<mhall119> oh, I see\n<mhall119> so maybe we need a special \"Local Time\" location that changes, but if you set it to a specific world city it doesn't?\n<dpm> WebbyIT, we were just saying that we now know why your merge proposal failed: the calendar UI has changed and it's no longer passing the autopilot tests (https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-calendar-app/1193090/+merge/170957) - balloons can help you to get them in shape so that the merge proposal is accepted\n<popey> kinda\n<mhall119> I'm assuming you can always get UTC time, and UTC time won't change when the network time changes\n<popey> the clock app should detect when timezone has changed and adjust display for \"the time here\" accordingly\n<nik90> mhall119: yes but if you set it to a specific world and the it doesnt change (after entering a new country) then you are restricting the user.\n<balloons> WebbyIT, indeed\n<popey> but the user should be able to override that to display the time back at home or somewhere else\n<WebbyIT> ok dpm, thanks. So, balloons, what have I to do? :)\n<mhall119> right, so then can we just have 1 \"Current local time\" and multiple \"Fixed location time\"?\n<nik90> popey, mhall119: I need a sort of decision proposal if you will. What to do in certain cases that we described above.\n<popey> effectively, yes\n<nik90> mhall119, popey: Can we document this in google docs? I already have one edited describing some case scenarios\n<balloons> WebbyIT, well the test that is failing is the test_new_event\n<popey> sure\n<balloons> So we need to update that to use the new date selectors (that's were it's failing)\n<mhall119> popey: nik90: design might have some advice on this too\n<popey> they were on the call\n<popey> but yes\n<nik90> mhall119, popey: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10f7sU1POjFWc1y1afiV3IynJxDQartyFsXcpexI--7w/edit\n<popey> nik90: i have comment rights only..\n<nik90> popey: just sent you an invite to your canonical email\n<popey> ok, ta\n<ayr_ton> mhall119, about the 3 and 4 work items in your blog for today hackfest.  For this is necessary a merge proposal in sdk-system-alarm-api first? Or I could do some merge proposal directly in the clock app for help in this?\n<mhall119> ayr_ton: it'll need an API and platform implementations, those are already planned and spec'd as far as I know, just need an engineer's time to implement them\n<mhall119> speaking of that, kaleo: is there anybody else who can pick that up while zsombi is on holiday?\n<balloons> so WebbyIT let me pull the branch and let's see what needs modified\n<kaleo> mhall119, breeding program? :)\n<WebbyIT> balloons: ok, thanks :)\n<mhall119> kaleo: I've done my quota\n<mhall119> kaleo: I assume you have a blueprint, milestones and work items for yours :)\n<mhall119> come to think of it, our monthly planning cycle is disturbing similar to those pre-natal planners\n<kaleo> mhall119, lol\n<ovenwolv> I don't know enough programming to help, but I am listening to heavy metal.  Just know that.\n<mhall119> ovenwolv: moral support, we appreciate it :)\n<balloons> ovenwolv, +1\n<ovenwolv> Excellent.  We appreciate you guys making a phone with linuxy goodness.\n<AskUbuntu> How can I add another version to available versions? | http://askubuntu.com/q/319318\n<dpm> ovenwolv, \\m/\n<ovenwolv> balloons and dpm, \\m/\n<ovenwolv> Getting ready to watch the video on creating an autopilot testcase\n<balloons> ovenwolv, :-)\n<timp> what should I imagine when I see \\m/ ?

However if your already to go on that front, take a look at these wiki pages: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/CoreApps/\n<balloons> Pick an app, go to that page and we can help you get the code and start hacking\n<balloons> WebbyIT, I'll push something in just a moment\n<mhall119> arielschon12: what kind of contribution do you want to make?\n<arielschon12> Well mhall119, First I just want to get my hands on the code and see what is going on\n<mhall119> arielschon12: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/CoreApps/DevelopmentGuide has a generic guide to getting the core apps code and submitting your changes\n<WebbyIT> balloons: you are awesome :D\n<arielschon12> Thanks guys :)\n<mhall119> thank you arielschon12, looking forward to seeing your merge proposals :)\n<arielschon12> Cool, thanks mhal!\n<arielschon12> And now off-topic, I am currently running MAC OS X 10.7.5 and I want to dual-boot it with ubuntu. I have tried it before, but stuff got messed up. Anyone knows how to do this (I am using an iMac, so wireless mouse and keyboard support is needed in the OS selection)\n<nik90> WebbyIT: I see that you have taken on another bug :). Just one thing to note, try using the ImageButton.qml component located in the stopwatch folder. This will allow you to get the same styling as the stopwatch lap,reset buttons.\n<nik90> I forgot to mention this in the bug report\n<WebbyIT> nik90: yes, I did it. Reset working great, now I'm working on pause function :)\n<ovenwolv> ariel, why not try a virtual machine on your desktop? Virtual box or vmware player should work fine, then you don't have to choose which OS to boot\n<balloons> wild.. well, I think I may just gut the test instead.\n<balloons> it seems like there is still more work to do.. it \"passes\" but I don't see a way to make an event at all :-(\n<mhall119> you might have problems getting the SDK apps running in a virtual machine, they require OpenGL ES support and last I heard VirtualBox didn't have that\n<mhall119> VMWare I heard works though\n<ovenwolv> I have 12.04 on VMWare player, with the QT SDK installed, but it could be missing something and I wouldn't necessarily be aware\n<WebbyIT> nik90: it seems that Jenkins can not stand me :-/ Here the MR for pause: https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-clock-app/1166264/+merge/174458\n<balloons> WebbyIT, see my comments on the merge\n<balloons> I took your branch and made some changes: https://code.launchpad.net/+branch/~nskaggs/ubuntu-calendar-app/autopilot-fixes-for-newevent\n<balloons> mhall119, are any of the calendar folks around?\n<nik90> WebbyIT: I have asked it to build it again.  Let try once more.\n<WebbyIT> balloons: ok, thanks :)\n<nik90> WebbyIT: Your code is perfect. I do not think that is the issue.\n<balloons> WebbyIT, does new event work for you? I can't seem to create one.. there's no save button I can see\n<WebbyIT> nik90: Ok, thanks :)\n<WebbyIT> balloons: no, both oSoMon and I have the same problem. If you launch it you have some errors: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5868534/\n<WebbyIT> balloons: but you can get around this, with some modification\n<balloons> WebbyIT, ok right.. so for the moment, I killed the test\n<mhall119> balloons: not that I see, why?\n<WebbyIT> balloons: FYI in NewEvent.qml you have to change line 130 from ListItem.SingleControl to ListItem.Empty and line 132 from control: Button to Button, and it works. I didn't do it because I don't know why is in that way, so I don't want to do damages.\n<balloons> mhall119, just wondering..\n<balloons> WebbyIT, well, hmm.. heh\n<balloons> so WebbyIT if your ok with my branch changes I'll merge that branch into trunk\n<balloons> it's just your changes + the autopilot fixes\n<WebbyIT> balloons: yes, certainly :)\n<balloons> ok, so let's do it\n<WebbyIT> balloons: ok, I link your branch to bug and delete my branch\n<balloons> WebbyIT, no that's ok\n<balloons> everything can stay as-is\n<balloons> including the request\n<WebbyIT> balloons: ah ok, as you wish\n<balloons> :-) I think it's saner to do it that way.. maybe others would like to see a new MP, but :-)\n<balloons> since I'm merging it, I get to choose I guess :-p\n<dpm> kaleo, speaking of dropping PPAs for the SDK saucy installation, that's already done in d.u.c -> http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started\n<dpm> popey, mhall119, just a FYI ^^\n<balloons> WebbyIT, basically you should be good.. I'l merge it in a moment\n<nik90> WebbyIT: your branch got merged :-)\n<nik90> WebbyIT: Told you that your code was fine :D\n<WebbyIT> nik90: good :) Now I'm going to move ImageButton.qml in common, so you can merge also other branch :)\n<Aviral_> i want to push modification in launchpad i has commited the content aviral@aviral-G31M-ES2L:~/animal-farm$ bzr push lp:~aviral190694/animal-farm/aviralupdate You have not informed bzr of your Launchpad ID, and you must do this to write to Launchpad or access private data.  See \"bzr help launchpad-login\". bzr: ERROR: Invalid url supplied to transport: \"bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/~aviral190694/animal-farm/aviralupdate\":\n<Aviral_> now it is shoing the above error after writing the branch push code\n<nik90> WebbyIT: be aware that when you do that, you need to also add a import statement in stopwatchpage.qml file\n<nik90> Aviral_: When did you submit your ssh key to launchpad?\n<nik90> Aviral_: it sometimes takes few hours to accept and recognise your keys.\n<Aviral_> ohh i had done it today only\n<mhall119> Aviral_: have you run \"bzr launchpad-login\"?\n<Aviral_> no\n<mhall119> bzr launchpad-login aviral190694\n<WebbyIT> nik90: I think is not necessary, because there is import \"../common\"\n<mhall119> that should tell bzr who you are on launchpad\n<xlrv> hello\n<WebbyIT> nik90: in fact, it works. Do you want that I explicitly import it ?\n<nik90> WebbyIT: ah yes. You are already more familiar with the code than I am :P\n<nik90> WebbyIT: nope you were right!\n<WebbyIT> nik90: ok, perfect :)\n<nik90> WebbyIT: can you move the button to the center since it is the only one present in the timer?\n<WebbyIT> nik90: sure\n<nik90> WebbyIT: you also need to reset the pause time to zero in the reset() function. Otherwise you can only run the timer once.\n<WebbyIT> nik90: good point\n<nik90> WebbyIT: Instead of adding a new variable \"pauseTime\" wouldn't it be better to assign a new  StartTime every the timer is paused? This is also the logic that the stopwatch makes use of. This way have one less variable to worry about.\n<nik90> You can take a look at the stopwatch logic on how it keeps time by manipulating the startTime\n<WebbyIT> nik90: I can do it, but I have to rewrite logical of the timer, that isn't the same of the stopWatch. Now the remTime = totalTime - Math.floor((new Date() - startTime)/ 1000), so I can't change startTime. I can add delay to startTime, but it's the same thing that i do with PauseTime. If you want i can change PauseTime in delay, and sum it when press pause\n * nik90 is thinking about the logic\n<AskUbuntu> How can TextField input be validated for long integers? | http://askubuntu.com/q/319355\n<WebbyIT> nik90: or, maybe I did not understand anything of logic\n<nik90> WebbyIT: can you update the code to reset the pause time. I will test it again. Because as of now, the timer does not work the second or third time when I set it.\n<nik90> in the reset() function that I mentioned earlier\n<nik90> let the code logic remain as you did for now\n<WebbyIT> nik90: done https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-clock-app/1166264/+merge/174458\n<WebbyIT> nik90: the last commit -> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-clock-app/1166264/revision/140\n<nik90> WebbyIT: actually I am fine with your code logic. Lets not change that. I am going to now keep testing to see if it fails in any cases.\n<nik90> WebbyIT: one small fix. Could you move the pauseTime = 0, to AnalogTimer.qml\n<nik90> there is a reset function in that file\n<nik90> there you can do startTime = remTime = pauseTime = 0\n<nik90> just my small nitpickings :)\n<WebbyIT> nik90: you're right, is right to write good code :) Done\n<nik90> Aviral_: is your issue fixed?\n<Aviral_> no :(\n<Aviral_> aviral@aviral-G31M-ES2L:~/animal-farm$ bzr push lp:~aviral190694/animal-farm/aviralupdate Permission denied (publickey).

I'm very interesting in helping the app :)\n<nik90> WebbyIT: On thursday 16:00 UTC. I will ask dpm or popey to send you an invite to it\n<nik90> WebbyIT: Its on g+ hangout.\n<popey> dpm will have to i think, it's in his calendar\n<nik90> popey: ok\n<nik90> popey: I will send him an email regarding this today\n<nik90> would love to have WebbyIT in these meetings :)\n<WebbyIT> nik90:  ok thanks :)\n<popey> thanks\n<popey> ditto!\n<nik90> WebbyIT: oh by the way, if you can you should join the dev weekly meeting on Friday from 19:30 UTC - 20:00 UTC\n<nik90> which is today in another 1hour\n<WebbyIT> nik90:  it would be great to work side by side with people like you :)\n<nik90> the meeting is with popey and mhall119\n<popey> wow, 19:11 my time and I now notice the /topic wrong\n<popey> so sorry nik90\n<WebbyIT> nik90: yes, on #ubuntu-touch-meeting?\n<nik90> WebbyIT: yes\n<nik90> WebbyIT: So to summarise, we meet every week on Thursday (16:00 UTC) and on Friday (19:30 UTC)\n<WebbyIT> nik90: I'll be there :)\n<nik90> popey: did not notice. I actually almost forgot today's meeting :P until I mentioned it\n<nik90> WebbyIT: great!\n<nik90|Dinner> alrite I am of to dinner. brb in about 1 hour\n* popey changed the topic of #ubuntu-app-devel to: http://developer.ubuntu.com | App development on Ubuntu: how to do it & how to make it better | HackDays! http://bit.ly/12Ux0vM | Thu 12th July is Clock App HackDay! http://bit.ly/1agnlBJ | Clock App Bugs: http://bit.ly/1ahmf8W | Clock App Blueprint: http://bit.ly/15nKOO7\n<popey> better late than never!\n<nik90|Dinner> WebbyIT: latest bug fix by you merged successful by jenkins bot\n<WebbyIT> nik90|Dinner: great :)\n<popey> yo\n<bobweaver> what up G\n<bobweaver> :)\n<popey> :D\n<bobweaver> so clock app today what are some of the things that you might be having issues with\n<bobweaver> like logic things or need c++ plugins or anything like that ?\n<popey> the bugs are listed in the /topic\n<popey> the clock app is mostly there tbh\n<popey> if you're interested in helping with other apps then they're all listed on the hackdays link above\n<popey> the only ones that use a c++ plugin are the file manager (mostly done) and the music app (needs design work)\n<popey> they both use the same plugin - nemo..\n<mhall119> terminal also has a C++ plugin\n<popey> ah yes\n<domasdev> whats the hacksday link\n<esigolo> http://bit.ly/12Ux0vM\n<bobweaver> Hey my apps also have c++ plugins\n<bobweaver> :)\n<bobweaver> but I only have zeroconf and system tools and mysql database c++ plugins\n<bobweaver> mostly dns_sd , QProcess and QSql stuff\n<bobweaver> popey,  are there plans at all to move the core apps to use applicationView so that it will be a single binary and one will not have to run qmlscene?\n<mhall119> bobweaver: we meant of the Core Apps\n<bobweaver> :)\n<mhall119> bobweaver: applicationView being a C++ thing?\n<popey> i think there's a plan to have a more lightweight application start framework\n<bobweaver> kinda mhall119  like using QGuiApplication  and QCoreApplication and QQmlEngine\n<bobweaver> having it so you do not have to use qmlscence\n<mhall119> bobweaver: like popey said, I think the plan is to replace qmlscene with another generic, but more functional, application runner\n<bobweaver> cool\n<mhall119> but we don't plan to include a C++ launcher in each app\n<bobweaver> mhall119,  something like this https://launchpad.net/~josephjamesmills/+archive/sdk-extras\n<bobweaver> the ubuntu-tabs-cpp package that I made a while ago\n<bobweaver> needs work needs to install the qml source directorys to a better place as debian files(auto generated ) say no no on installing files on them selfs\n<bobweaver> It just creates a new wizard that has packaging questions and forms to fill out that fill in the debian/* files has a tabs application that you can build for debugging or for release\n<kaleo> seb128, still around?\n<seb128> kaleo, lol, I was just calling it a week ... I've a few minutes to answer a question though ;-)\n<kaleo> seb128, I was testing your app again\n<kaleo> seb128, and I'm really puzzled by the flicking in the main menu\n<kaleo> seb128, it feels so different from everywhere else\n<kaleo> seb128, what's doing that?\n<seb128> the fact that it goes offscreen like that?\n<kaleo> seb128, you are not using a Flickable or a ListView?\n<seb128> I am\n<kaleo> seb128, it does not go offscreen at all\n<kaleo> seb128, just it slows down very differently\n<kaleo> seb128, compare it with the dash for example\n<seb128> you are the toolkit guy, tell me what I'm doing wrong :p\n<kaleo> seb128, which file should I look at?\n<seb128> we are using flickable a column in it\n<seb128> what screen are you on?\n<kaleo> seb128, main\n<seb128> do you have the same issue in e.g about?\n<kaleo> seb128, let me sese\n<kaleo> -s\n<kaleo> seb128, yes\n<kaleo>                 boundsBehavior: Flickable.StopAtBounds\n<kaleo> that's not supposed to be there :)\n<seb128> kenvandine added that\n<seb128> without it things were acting weird\n<seb128> e.g flicking on a dialog that fit on screen would send it off screen\n<seb128> which feels buggy\n<seb128> why would you want any scrolling on something that fits on screen?\n<kenvandine> kaleo, we had a screens without enough content to fill them\n<seb128> especially on a desktop\n<kenvandine> yet you could still drag\n<seb128> using a wheel scroll you could get the UI way off screen\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, hmmm,\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, so, it might be the wrong solution\n<kenvandine> perhaps :)\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, and whatever the solution is, it should go in the toolkit\n<seb128> right\n<kaleo>  so that all apps benefits\n<kaleo> -s\n<seb128> kenvandine, did you open a toolkit bug about that?\n<kenvandine> no\n<seb128> we should do that\n<kaleo> I'm testing a bit\n<kenvandine> this is the behavior of any flickable\n<seb128> kaleo, sorry about the lack of bug filling\n<kenvandine> which is outside of our toolkit\n<kaleo> kenvandine, that's the only property you set to fix the issue?\n<kenvandine> i think so\n<seb128> yes\n<kaleo> kenvandine, yes, but we have power of Qt :\n<kaleo> kenvandine, :)\n<kenvandine> so unless we want to have our own flickable\n<seb128> kaleo, try on the about panel, it's easier to edit (you can edit the .qml without rebuilding)\n<kaleo> kenvandine, that also is a possible option\n<kaleo> kenvandine, Qt Quick Controls has that\n<kaleo> seb128, ok\n<kenvandine> the downside with that is all the existing components wouldn't inherit from that, would they?\n<kaleo> seb128, MainWindow.qml is built into the binary?\n<seb128> yes\n<kaleo> kenvandine, inded\n<kaleo> +e\n<kaleo> kenvandine, but let's first figure it out\n<kaleo> seb128, not cool\n<seb128> kaleo, plugins/about/PageComponent.qml is not (that's the about panel)\n<kaleo> seb128, unless it's strictly necessary I would avoid bundling QML files into the binary\n<seb128> kaleo, yeah, tell mardy, he did the main UI thing\n<kaleo> seb128, that's a side point obviosuly\n<kaleo> seb128, :)\n<seb128> the panels don't do that\n<kenvandine> so perhaps Qt's flickable should be modified :)\n<kaleo> seb128, you'll know for later\n<kaleo> kenvandine, perhaps\n<seb128> noted, thanks ;-)\n<kenvandine> kaleo, yeah... that seems to be mardy's preference\n<kaleo> kenvandine, or made configurable at a system level, if it's not already the case\n<seb128> I didn't like it anyway\n<kaleo> kenvandine, I'll tell him off\n<seb128> since it's harder to hack and test changes :p\n<kaleo> seb128, exactly\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, so yeah without                  boundsBehavior: Flickable.StopAtBounds it feels much better\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, let me make a page with little content\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, so you can still scroll and it bounces back, it's not that bad, let me see a bit more\n<kenvandine> seb128 and i both found it terribly annoying\n<kenvandine> try the reset plugin\n<seb128> kaleo, try on a desktop with a wheel/trackpad scroll\n<seb128> but even on the device\n<seb128> if you try on android they don't make things scroll offscreen when you touch them on a page that fits in screen\n<seb128> (just tried on my phone)\n<kaleo> seb128, ok, I think the solution is to make it conditional\n<kaleo> kenvandine, ^\n<Joe_B> Is it possible to set the location from within the app?\n<kaleo> seb128, if contentHeight bigger than height then DragAndOvershootBounds\n<kaleo> seb128, else StopAtBounds\n<seb128> that seems tedious\n<kaleo> seb128, tedious to implement?\n<seb128> shouldn't the toolkit Do The Right Thing\n<seb128> no, easy to implement\n<kaleo> seb128, well, yes, I'm talking about the solution that would go in the toolkit\n<seb128> but it means every single app have to go through discover and implement that\n<seb128> ok, good ;-)\n<kenvandine> kaleo, that would be fine\n<kaleo> seb128, cf discussion from before :)\n<seb128> right\n<seb128> +1 from me\n<kaleo> soooooooo\n<kenvandine> but it should go in Qt imo\n<kaleo> kenvandine, agreed\n<kenvandine> so all flickable's benefit\n<kaleo> kenvandine, maybe a boundsBehavior new type\n<seb128> don't get me started on the list of things qt doesn't do for you ;-)\n<kenvandine> hehe\n<seb128> (like wth with column not working if you don't put the anchors on left and right)\n<kenvandine> if a new type, i think it should be the default :)\n<kaleo> kenvandine, yes\n<kaleo> kenvandine, at least for Ubuntu\n<kenvandine> i can't think of a case where you want want to be able to do this\n<seb128> (or listviews not working if you fill them but don't specify an height)\n<kenvandine> seb128, oh that is annoying!\n<kaleo> kenvandine, agreed\n<seb128> kenvandine, yeah, I'm still not sure I like qt because of those things :/\n<kaleo> seb128, lol\n<kenvandine> seb128, well... still far less frustrating than gtk :)\n<seb128> it's so annoying that you take a listview, pack it with a model and get nothing on screen\n<kaleo> seb128, like all the other benefits are not enough\n<kaleo> seb128, it's good you konw\n<seb128> then spend an hour trying to figure why\n<kaleo> seb128, i that's the biggest   yissues you have\n<seb128> \"oh, heigh is 0 if you don't specify it\"\n<kaleo> seb128, that's a good sign\n<kaleo> seb128, I agree though\n<kaleo> seb128, the width/height being 0 and nobody telling you is bad\n<kaleo> seb128, at the very least QtCreator should tell you\n<seb128> kaleo, yeah, I like it most of the time, it's just so details that are really annoying and bit most of the beginners\n<seb128> just *those* details*\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, I suggest in the meantime for the system settings app:\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, 1) create a CustomFlickable.qml that factors the code you have\n<kaleo> (it's repeated in multiple places\n<kaleo> seb128, kenvandine, 2) implement the behaviour described above\n<kenvandine> that's why i want a mode in qmlscene to run with red boxes around each element... just like firebug\n<kaleo> kenvandine, that would not show 0x0 items :)\n<kaleo> kenvandine, and if you use QtCreator's QML debugger\n<kenvandine> kaleo, it should :)\n<kaleo> kenvandine, you can click on the UI\n<kaleo> kenvandine, and it takes you to the code\n<kenvandine> dude... i've never had luck with that\n<kaleo> kenvandine, why not? :)\n<kaleo> kenvandine, well, not being able to run the app locally does not help :)\n<kenvandine> i fought with getting it to load at all\n<kaleo> kenvandine, that's very odd\n<kenvandine> not just for systems settings\n<kenvandine> mostly with friends-app, instagram, etc...\n<kaleo> kenvandine, I can take a look when we meet\n<kenvandine> i gave up on trying :)\n<kaleo> kenvandine, works fine here :\n<kaleo> :)\n<kenvandine> so i've heard :)\n<kenvandine> what i want though is to be able to hi-lite all the components and maybe a zoom for the 0x0 items\n<kenvandine> so you can play with it\n<seb128> kaleo, ok, thanks for the advice, I'm going to have a look to the customflickable and fill a bug on the toolkit about that\n<seb128> kenvandine, ^ if you want to beat me to it feel free, otherwise I can do that on monday\n<seb128> not today though, enough work for this week ;-)\n<kaleo> seb128, thank you\n<kaleo> seb128, sorry for the extra work\n<seb128> kenvandine, kaleo: well, even without the 0x0 widget issues, having borders around elements would be nice, I keep changing my Items for Rectangles in custom widget to see what's going on\n<seb128> kaleo, no worry\n<kenvandine> oh... so it does seem to work with something that is pure qml\n<seb128> ok, on that note, enough for me for this week\n<seb128> have a nice w.e everyone\n<seb128> see you next week\n<bobweaver> kenvandine,  why not use QtQuick.Window 2.0 and use Screen.height/width  and console.log that to app on start up ?  or set the Window in c++ to be like    QtQuick2ApplicationViewer k;   k.showMaximized();  or something like that showFullscreen() ect\n<kenvandine> bobweaver, for what?\n<bobweaver> kenvandine,  for your Items\n<bobweaver> and debugging like you where talking about above ^^\n<kenvandine> you mean to see when something is 0x0?\n<kenvandine> but i don't care about screen size... what i want is to see how big each item is\n<kenvandine> not just how big\n<kenvandine> but also hi-lite them\n<kenvandine> so you can mouse over and see what element is what\n<bobweaver> this is a Model ?\n<kenvandine> no, just a general complaint\n<kenvandine> during development people often don't see the results they expect\n<kenvandine> and it's can be a pita to see why the height is 0, etc\n<kenvandine> i want something like firebug for qml :)\n<bobweaver> kenvandine,  Item {width: Math.round(Screen.width / whatever) Rectangle{id:foo; width: Math.round(Screen.width / 2)    }  MosueArea{hoverenabled: true;  onEntered:{tooltip.opacity = 1 ; tooltipText.text = foo.width +\"\\n\"+foo.height}  } Rectangle{id:tooltip; }   }\n<bobweaver> make sure that you import QtQuick.Window 2.0\n<kenvandine> something like that\n<kenvandine> but i want it to be part of the toolkit\n<bobweaver> I would make my own Elements for ToolTip and what not\n<kenvandine> yeah, that isn't as interesting\n<bobweaver> I think that there is tooltip in QtQuick.Controls\n<kenvandine> i don't want it for me... but for everyone that gets annoyed figuring out what is going on\n<bobweaver> Think being keyword\n<kenvandine> QML_FIREBUG=1 qmlscene foo.qml\n<kenvandine> and you magically get outlines or bgcolor changes on hover :)\n<bobweaver> yeah it sux when you are like what is wrong with my list/grid/path View and it is not that at all it is your delegate or somethingmlike that\n<kenvandine> yeah\n<kenvandine> or you set height to some other component's height\n<kenvandine> which turns out to be 0\n<kenvandine> so you don't see it at all\n<kenvandine> annoying things like that waste too much time\n<bobweaver> +1\n<bobweaver> console.log(\"Is my Friend\")\n<kenvandine> yeah... me too\n<kenvandine> but i hate debugging that way\n<bobweaver> I mean you could make that happen real easy with c++ in ones main.cpp (if that is ones main cpp file )\n<bobweaver> considering that it is qmlscene there is not bound to be any c++ files\n<bobweaver> dont understand why people do not want c++ in there qml . oO*  I mean qml is c++ plugins and what not.\n<bobweaver> there is no tooltip in QtQuick.Controls only toolbars and toolbuttons\n<timp> bobweaver: what do you want a tooltip for?\n<bobweaver> timp,  I dont but me and ken where talking about debugging and options\n<timp> ok :)\n<jdstrand> mhall119: hey, I need to write an app that has a little C++\n<jdstrand> mhall119: I don't see any C++ templates under the Ubuntu project in qtcreator\n<jdstrand> oh, wait, maybe I

Then we can approve the Reminders .click package that we've got pending approval in the store\n<popey> dpm: sure\n<popey> dpm: ooh, looks like #114 got it over the weekend\n<popey> dpm: http://people.canonical.com/~ogra/touch-image-stats/114.changes\n<popey> account-plugin-evernote from 0+14.04.20140113.2-0ubuntu1 to 0.4+14.10.20140704-0ubuntu1\n<popey> davmor2: you dogfooding any particular image?\n<dpm> popey, awesome, does it look promotable? :)\n<popey> it seems okay to me, but thats up to davmor2\n<davmor2> popey: I'm looking at todays but I don't think the tests were looking like it would be promoted\n<popey> ok\n<popey> ta\n<popey> dholbach: DanChapman I have reverted dekko back, as I shouldn't have hit approve. sorry.\n<dholbach> popey, I approved it too ;-)\n<popey> haha\n<popey> doh\n<dholbach> what happened?\n<popey> ok, re-approved\n<DanChapman> haha :-D\n<popey> i hit the wrong button\n<popey> ignore me, i need more coffee\n<ogra_> is the \"list never updates after first poll\" a known bug in dekko btw ?\n<dholbach> thanks popey, danchapman :)\n<ogra_> i can see there are new unread mails in the mailbox overview ... but as soon as i click on inbox there are no new ones ... nor do they get pulled when i click on refresh\n<DanChapman> ogra_, yes it's a known bug, if you go back and then back into inbox it should fetch the rest\n<ogra_> it doesnt\n<nik90_> kalikiana: need your help with https://code.launchpad.net/~nik90/ubuntu-clock-app/add-custom-sound-backend/+merge/225812\n<nik90_> kalikiana: for some reason, when I open a saved alarm, the alarm sound url is blank\n<nik90_> kalikiana: I specifically created a new alarm and set the alarm sound manually. I also outputted alarm.sound to check that the proper alarm sound url is saved. However when reading the saved alarm properties, the sound url is always empty\n<DanChapman> ogra_, meh :-( it should be fetching the new ones on 're-opening' a mailbox. The refresh button seems to be only fetching the headers but they aren't bubbling down to the the threadedlistmodel. I'll dig into it\n<ogra_> thanks ... it doesnt even update on app restart\n<DanChapman> ouch\n<ogra_> seems i can only get the first list that was ever pulled ...\n<davmor2> DanChapman: just the chap :)\n<davmor2> DanChapman: Over the weekend had a couple of issues that I will bug shortly, 1. dekko forgot my password so I got the popup box which was good to test but completely unexpected and 2 it got into a sync state with my inbox that meant it wasn't updating.  It worked fine on another folder and then eventually got unstuck on the inbox\n<ogra_> funny, my inboxseems constantly stuck\n<renato__> popey, hey are you around?\n<davmor2> DanChapman: I'm wondering if that issue is down to using more than 1 email client.  IE if claws/thunderbird/evolution moves a mail while dekko is syncing that it screws up the sync\n<popey> renato__: ya\n<renato__> popey, could you approve this MR: https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-calculator-app/1332567/+merge/225225,\n<davmor2> ogra_: ^ did you have another email client filtering by any chance?\n<ogra_> davmor2, a ton :)\n<renato__> popey, this is very critical, the calculator is doing wrong math :D\n<ogra_> one on every device\n<popey> oh i thought it had already been approved\n<renato__> popey, and this is pending for a while\n<ogra_> blamepopey\n<popey> renato__: thanks, will update in store later today\n<renato__> popey, thanks\n<renato__> popey, if you update in the store its get update in the image?\n<xeranas> hi all, anyone have recommendation for javascript game library which play nice alongside with ubuntu sdk?\n<popey> renato__: ya\n<renato__> popey, nice\n<davmor2> ogra_: can you sync another folder?\n<renato__> popey, a question about the store. If a package get update in the store should I get any notification on my device about updates?\n<ogra_> davmor2, it doesnt show my subfolders under Inbox ... so no, i cant\n<ogra_> (and i'm happy to only have inbox)\n<davmor2> ogra_: meh that's a shame\n<renato__> popey, I am asking because I never got notified :(\n<popey> depends\n<ogra_> davmor2, nah, i like that ... i want only important mails on my phone ... and these are the unfiltered ones that land in inbox\n<popey> if they're in the image that you update to, then you get them via that way\n<popey> renato__: if you dont update your phone image, you'll get them via the store\n<davmor2> ogra_: also what happens if you sync and keep the phone awake I'm wondering if once the app loses focus it loses it's internet connection and that stops the sync and it never recovers\n<ogra_> well, it will need to use the push service in the long term i think\n<ogra_> probably not in the first iteration :)\n<kalikiana> nik90_: please ping me about it tomorrow as I'm leaving for the day, then I'll have a look\n<kalikiana> nik90_: or feel free to send me an email with a summary\n<rpadovani> oSoMoN, o/ Could you ping me when you have 5 minutes please? It's about a segmentation fault with Oxide\n<davmor2> DanChapman: also multipart emails don't show you just get a message that it can't show it you :)\n<daker> rpadovani: check if you have \"webview\" in your apparmor file\n<DanChapman> davmor2, yes multipart messages that do not contain a text/plain part and say only have an html counterpart cannot be displayed (Well they can but it will always download all content, which is bad) there is a bug in webkit that we can't do multiple async requests in order to intercept and prompt for user permission to download content\n<oSoMoN> rpadovani, ping, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up with that segfault?\n<davmor2> DanChapman: I think this was plain text let me double check though\n<davmor2> DanChapman: Ah there we go so the main body was plain text there was a store logo and a white square which were html only\n<DanChapman> davmor2, right ok, that's strange. What is the message you get when you open it?\n<davmor2> DanChapman: http://davmor2.co.uk/~davmor2/screenshots-phone/device-2014-07-07-144040.png\n<DanChapman> davmor2, thanks, so there seems to be no logic for multipart/related atm. Looking at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2387 seems that it should be treated as multipart/mixed which makes it easier to pick out the plain text parts. I'll file a bug for that\n<davmor2> DanChapman: thanks\n<bfiller> popey: do you know the status of the content-hub work in the music app? I know the guys were working on it last week..\n<popey> bfiller: andrew was having some difficulties and wanted to get some time from kenvandine, but he was on vacation, but back now?\n<bfiller> popey: yes he's back\n<kenvandine> bfiller, yup... back now :)\n<popey> ok, will get an update from andrew when he's online later and poke kenvandine\n<bfiller> kenvandine: welcome back ken :)\n<popey> kenvandine: did ahayzen mail you about content-hub in music?\n<popey> (also, wb)\n<bfiller> popey: I know he was talking to Elleo as well\n<popey> yeah, I dont know if he got all the answers he wanted, last spoke to him on thursday\n<popey> will poke when he's online\n<kenvandine> popey, i don't think so, but i am drowning in emails\n<popey> i can imagine \u00e2\u0098\u00bb\n<davmor2> kenvandine: what this tell you about time off, it's not good for you damn it ;)\n<Elleo> kenvandine: I don't think the original email was sent to you, but it looks like I CC'd you in on my reply (\"Re: content-hub examples\")\n<kenvandine> davmor2, one way to look at it...\n<kenvandine> Elleo, ah, i see that one\n<fdasdf> popey: Just wanted to say: I saw your post on G+ last Friday about new stuff landing, and it's really cool to see the icon for my program in your dash.\n<kenvandine> Elleo, oh... file locations...\n<kenvandine> at least for the near term, that needs to be up to the app\n<popey> fdasdf: which one is yours? \u00e2\u0098\u00bb\n<kenvandine> i'm really not excited about the idea of the hub needing to ensure apps have proper permissions to files\n<fdasdf> popey: failsauce\n<kenvandine> kind of the whole reason my the hub exists :)\n<popey> fdasdf: haha\n<popey> fdasdf: needs more trombone noises\n<Elleo> kenvandine: yeah, that's hard for QML apps though; I did wonder about adding a copy/move function to the QML bindings, that way they'd be doing the operation in the confinement of the app but it sounds like the music app is going ot have difficulties if the files aren't in place before it starts\n<fdasdf> popey: I can't get the emulator working in the sdk, so I have no way to see any feedback, any chance you could tell me what the reviews say?\n<Elleo> kenvandine: although arguably that's something that needs fixing in the music app, since really it should be able to accept new music arriving at any time\n<kenvandine> Elleo, yeah, i think that makes sense\n<fdasdf> popey: I had to use CC sounds, but I'll work on releasing v1.01 with enhanced fail ;)\n<kenvandine> it would be a nice convienence for qml apps\n<Elleo> yeah\n<kenvandine> Elleo, similar to why i added toDataURI\n<Elleo> kenvandine: yep\n<davmor2> DanChapman: Also it's not an Error that the email client disconnected due to inactivity It's deliberate :)\n<kenvandine> ContentItem.move(\"destPath\")\n<kenvandine> maybe\n<Elleo> yeah\n<popey> fdasdf: \"awesome! made my day\" and \"could have more sounds\"\n<kenvandine> and in the QML bindings, confinement would protect us\n<popey> fdasdf: one 5*, one 3*\n<fdasdf> popey: I'm going to have to step up my game then. ;)\n<fdasdf> I appreciate the help\n<popey> np\n<davmor2> kenvandine: changing the subject slightly, could you potentially create a 2d top down zeldaesque game in bacon2d?\n<Elleo> heh\n<kenvandine> davmor2, potentially :)\n<kenvandine> but... considering i'm mostly spending my spare time working on the engine... hopefully i'm enabling other developers to create a zeldaesque game :)\n<popey> fdasdf: what I'd love to see in the store is a simple audio recording app\n<kenvandine> popey, i guess he didn't like that idea :)\n<davmor2> popey: need jhodapp to fix audio recording in media-hub first surely?\n<jhodapp> davmor2: yeah would love to have that, not going to happen for release\n<jhodapp> davmor2: it'll just be for camera recording\n<popey> awwwww\n<davmor2> jhodapp: Shame on you ;) It's almost as if the release was imminent :D\n<jhodapp> haha\n<popey> jhodapp: have we tested what happens when you get a call while making a video?\n<popey> ( I saw someone doing this on ios recently and it made me wonder )\n<jhodapp> popey: I haven't personally, no...that'd be a great test though\n<davmor2> popey: ooooooooo you see people\n<Elleo> kenvandine: when you get a chance could you review these two MRs together? https://code.launchpad.net/~michael-sheldon/gallery-app/finalize-transfers/+merge/225830 and https://code.launchpad.net/~michael-sheldon/content-hub/fix-export-finalization/+merge/225831\n<popey> ios users though\n<popey> so dead to me\n<jhodapp> popey: that'd be a good thing to add to the camera test plan\n<davmor2> popey: haha\n<jhodapp> lol\n<davmor2> jhodapp: indeed\n<Elleo> kenvandine: gallery wasn't finalising transfers when receiving files, so .cache wasn't getting cleaned up until content hub shut down, but I found that content-hub was closing receiving apps when finalizing() which I don't think is the correct behaviour, so there's an MR for that as well\n<kenvandine> ah, ok\n<Elleo> kenvandine: otherwise you say you want to open something with gallery, and then gallery gets closed as soon as it's finished the import\n<Elleo> kenvandine: but you may want to double check that I haven't missed some case where it actually should have been doing that\n<popey> jhodapp: oh, so audio recording is known broken in camera?\n<jhodapp> yes\n<popey> jhodapp: just tested, and it carries on recording when you get a call\n<popey> if you reject it that is\n<jhodapp> popey: oh cool, I assume that's what iOS does?\n<popey> i think ios stops, lemme test\n<kenvandine> Elleo, both of those branches look great, i need to test still\n<kenvandine> Elleo, i'll do that once i finish the settings testing\n<Elleo> kenvandine: okay, thanks :)\n<kenvandine> Elleo, good catch on the closing on finalize\n<Elleo> :)\n<nik90_> renato__: ping\n<renato__> nik90_, hi\n<nik90_> renato__: hey :)\n<davmor2> jhodapp: that might all change though when the sound recording lands of course I'm assuming that currently you are not using sound so you don't get it stopped when mediaplayer plays a sound right?\n<nik90_> renato__: i am having a small issue with setting custom sounds to the alarm in the clock app\n<jhodapp> davmor2: correct...it'll still work even when audio recording lands...recording isn't going through media-hub at all\n<davmor2> jhodapp: in which case it will likely pause in a similar fashion to media player and music\n<jhodapp> davmor2: straight from pulse audio\n<nik90_> renato__: The new clock app sets the correct file path to the alarm object and on reading .local/share/evolution/something/task.ics, I can see that the correct file path is attached\n<nik90_> renato__: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7760597/\n<davmor2> jhodapp: boo!\n<nik90_> renato__: however when I read the alarm, the sound url is empty\n<jhodapp> davmor2: but I do need to check with rsalveti's changes with pulse-droid...he might be \"corking\" the input stream as well when a call comes in, in which case it would pause\n<jhodapp> davmor2: but I'm pretty confident he's only corking output channels\n<jhodapp> Kaleo: love the new camera app btw, nice work\n<nik90_> renato__: do you have any ideas why that might happen?\n<nik90_> renato__: I am testing this in a branch at https://code.launchpad.net/~nik90/ubuntu-clock-app/add-custom-sound-backend/+merge/225812\n<renato__> nik90_, could you create a small qml example, and report a bug against eds and skd, this will help me and sdk guys to figure out where is the bug\n<nik90_> renato__: yeah I will do that\n<rpadovani> oSoMoN, sorry, was study, are you still here?\n<rpadovani> *studying\n<oSoMoN> rpadovani, yes but about to leave, you pinged me about a segfault, right?\n<rpadovani> oSoMoN, yap\n<oSoMoN> rpadovani, do you have more details?\n<rpadovani> oSoMoN, I updated the reminders app to use Oxide, and it works when it's in tablet mode, but when it's in phone mode it crashes\n<rpadovani> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7760088/\n<DanChapman> davmor2, ahh yes that's very true :-), a quick look at it and it seems it coming from the networkError signal hence I set the generic 'Network Error' title. I think when auto reconnect is implemented that should disappear anyway\n<rpadovani> oSoMoN, in side mode the webview is in a side view, and in phone mode is in a pagestack. I'm not able (yet) to reproduce out of the reminders app, maybe is a combination between reminders & oxide, maybe with the bt you're able to tell me what's wrong\n<oSoMoN> rpadovani, gotta leave for today, would you mind filing a bug at https://bugs.launchpad.net/oxide/+filebug with as many details as possible, and assign to me?\n<davmor2> DanChapman: I don't mind the notice.

I know it because the new version has the module and the old version doesn't\n<balloons> and yes I've hit it\n<t2mp> hello\n<gerlowskija> Ok just checking if I was being stupid.  It looks like I have the latest version installed (0.1.46+14.10.20140520-0ubuntu1~0trusty2, which matches the Latest Version, at least according to synaptic).  But I'll play with it a bit.  Thanks for the pointer balloons!\n<balloons> gerlowskija, it's not.. if you are on trusty, you have an old version\n<t2mp> I'm wondering, did anyone install Ubuntu on a Chromebook and use it for development (mainly qml using qtcreator)?\n<balloons> t2mp, I've done so\n<t2mp> my main laptop just broke and I'm considering to get a cheap chromebook as a backup\n<t2mp> balloons: I'm considering an Acer C720, any experience with that?\n<t2mp> balloons: did you use a chromebook with intel or arm cpu?\n<balloons> c720 should work fine\n<balloons> I used intel cpu\n<balloons> use crouton or straight install\n<balloons> c720 is popular for installing ubuntu\n<t2mp> oh, cool :)\n<t2mp> balloons: did you run qtc on it? or compile cpp code? (qml plugins, nothing huge)\n<t2mp> probably I'll prefer a straight install.. chromeos doesn't give me any advantage when I have ubuntu installed already\n<ahayzen> t1mp, t2mp, if i have a TextField for search and no actions on that page... should the search field expand the full width?\n<t2mp> ahayzen: t1mp doesn't hear you because the laptop screen broke...\n<ahayzen> t2mp, omg :(\n<t2mp> ahayzen: nope, the header does not set the width of its children\n<t2mp> ahayzen: I am chatting on an ipad with a usb keyboard now... :s\n<ahayzen> t2mp, hah ... so do i have to set the width?\n<t2mp> ahayzen: I recommend to put width: parent ? parent.width : undefined in your textfield\n<t2mp> hmm\n<ahayzen> t2mp, thanks i'll try tht\n<t2mp> ahayzen: or perhaps anchors.right: parent ? parent.right : undefined is better\n<balloons> t2mp, I didn't go too nuts on it no.. the c720 is more powerful than whatI was running\n<t2mp> left and verticalCenter anchors are already set by the header, but no right anchor or width\n<ahayzen> t2mp, thanks i'll try both :)\n<t2mp> ahayzen: if both work, I would go for the anchors.right :)\n<t2mp> ahayzen: let me know if it works well\n<ahayzen> t2mp, yep agreed :)\n<ahayzen> t2mp, will do\n<t2mp> ahayzen: TextField has a default width which you are probably getting now\n<t2mp> balloons: ahh.. sounds good :) thanks for the info :)\n<ahayzen> t2mp, yeah thats what i was starting to think\n<t2mp> balloons: the disk-size worries me a bit.. but luckily it has one USB3 port :)\n<ahayzen> t2mp, would that be an ARM based chromebook?\n<t2mp> ahayzen: no it is intel-based\n * ahayzen has always wondered how cool a ARM laptop with SSD would run\n<balloons> t2mp, I keep everything in the cloud. development stuff never amounts to much\n<balloons> I kept an armhf chroot in the cloud too.. that could be annoying to have locally sizewise\n<hobojo> how can I quickly see exactly which Qt version I have installed?\n<t2mp> ahayzen: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=acer_c720_ubuntu1404&num=1\n<ahayzen> balloons, just my ~/Workspace/sdk ... has reached 1GB now !\n<t2mp> hobojo: qmake --version\n<balloons> ahayzen, :p\n<hobojo> excellent, thanks\n<hobojo> bbye\n<balloons> ahayzen, want to have some fun?\n<ahayzen> balloons, define fun\n<balloons> I'll note you probably should never answer yes to a question like that from me\n<ahayzen> balloons, if that means removing my sdk again then....\n<balloons> ahayzen, no it's migrating to a new test runner\n<balloons> want to migrate music?\n<ahayzen> balloons, ooo\n<t2mp> balloons: yeah, I have most of my stuff in 'the cloud' as well\n<t2mp> and a whole bunch of branches from launchpad\n<ahayzen> balloons, yeah that would be cool\n<t2mp> but those I can delete when I am done with them\n<ahayzen> t2mp, so the width 'worked' but it goes right up to the right edge... just gonna try anchors.right to see what happens\n<t2mp> ahayzen: parent.width - units.gu(1), or anchors { right: parent.right; rightMargin: units.gu(1)\n<t2mp> ahayzen: the margins for the header stuff still need to be tweaked (also for the touch areas of the buttons which should probably be larger than the icons)\n<ahayzen> balloons, i/we/someone badly needs to go through the ap test code... we have 'songsPage' meaning both the page on the tracks tab.... and the generic songs page which you get to after selecting an album\n<ahayzen> balloons, then u have chaos with naming of album/artist tab/page/and what was sheets\n<ahayzen> balloons, but i'll probably do that once i've got all  of these big landings out of the way and everything has calmed down\n<ahayzen> t2mp, anchors right with the margin works perfectly :_\n * ahayzen high fives t2mp \n<bluezone> this app of mine is never going to make it to the store haha\n<balloons> ahayzen, https://bugs.launchpad.net/music-app/+bug/1338790\n<ubot5> Ubuntu bug 1338790 in Ubuntu RSS Feed Reader App \"Autopilot tests need to use autopkgtest runner\" [Undecided,New]\n<balloons> ahayzen, ahh yes.. objectnames probably are confusing.. you can feel free to rename them safely. update the qml, find/replace update the tests\n<ahayzen> balloons, this looks like fun :)\n<ahayzen> balloons, i think some test names need updating as well\n * ahayzen can't remember if trunk ended up with his renaming of _sheets_ to _pages_\n<t2mp> ahayzen: what's in your ~/Workspace/sdk?\n<t2mp> ahayzen: qtc installs in the system when you install the ubuntu-sdk package\n<t2mp> hello gerry\n * t2mp high-fives ahayzen back :)\n<greyback> t2mp: hey\n<ahayzen> t2mp, every single branch i've branched/made with the sdk.... so this http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7762186/\n<t2mp> ahayzen: ahh..

Normal qmlproject apps are failing due to some authentication failures for phablet\n<t2mp> bluezone: you don't have a firewall? ;)\n<ahayzen> nik90_, i use my own custom script..... because music-app was always a bit hacky lol\n<ahayzen> nik90_, but basically all that now is doing is ... click-buddy --dir . --provision\n<nik90_> ahayzen: ah ok\n<ahayzen> How can i store multiple QML objects in an array in a property, i'm sure i've done this before but i keep getting 'Cannot assign multiple values to a singular property' ...\n<bluezone> Ok i think i'll ask i hope i don't get shot/slapped/ignored haha\n<bluezone> [davmor2] is away (Auto-away because client has disconnected from proxy.) i hope he still gets the PM hehe\n<ahayzen> nik90_, i have two actions in the header and the drawer button appears is that correct?\n<nik90_> ahayzen: I thought it was 3 actions minimum to trigger the drawer.

Running on device it tries to launch and just dies out output looks like http://paste.ubuntu.com/7762347/. I'm just gonna see if dekko builds and runs from this new QtC as the clock app definately worked both desktop and device the other with just changing the desktop file name\n<nik90_> DanChapman: yeah give Dekko builds a try since I had similar experiences. Previously I was atleast able to run on the desktop, but now even that is completely broken\n<DanChapman> nik90_, one thing i did notice when i had it running on the phone (you may already know this) is the Add City animation happens behind the indicator panel and you only begin to see it after the animation has completed.\n<nik90_> DanChapman: unfortunately I haven't been able to run the new clock app on the phone. So I cannot see what's going wrong there :/\n<nik90_> DanChapman: this is precisely why I have been pushing to getting the clock app run on the device\n<nik90_> DanChapman: I have sent a mail to that mailing list thread with the feedback. Let's see where that leads to\n<DanChapman> nik90_, ack, well i will try and help you get it sorted :-). Anyway Dekko desktop ran fine so something's going on with the cmake here.\n<nik90_> DanChapman: so Dekko builds fine before and after the ppa install?\n<DanChapman> yep all seems good to me so far just going to kick of a chroot build that should be done in about 8+ minutes so we'll see about run on device aswell\n<nik90_> ok\n<balloons> ahayzen, if you are still up\n<ahayzen> balloons, o/\n<balloons> ahayzen, lp:~nskaggs/music-app/autopkg is the branch\n<balloons> it works for me\n<ahayzen> balloons, blimey not much changed :)\n<balloons> nope, really simple\n<balloons> so, to run it\n<balloons> build a click package, then cd outside of the directory\n<balloons> then run adt-run -d --shell music-app/ com.ubuntu.music_1.3.517_all.click --- \\ssh -s /usr/share/autopkgtest/ssh-setup/adb\n<balloons> if you have connected device, it should copy things, setup, and eventually run the tests\n<ahayzen> balloons, ok on it..\n<balloons> with the change you should also be able to run locally in a sandbox, or the emulator\n<ahayzen> balloons, ... i'm on trusty?\n<balloons> ahayzen, ohh hmm\n<balloons> not sure it's released to trusty\n<balloons> autopkg that is\n<balloons> let's see\n<ahayzen> adt-run\n<ahayzen> The program 'adt-run' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\n<ahayzen> sudo apt-get install autopkgtest\n<ahayzen> balloons, autopkgtest: Installed: 2.14.1\n<balloons> ahayzen, ahh I see\n<balloons> yep, won't work\n<balloons> you need > 3\n<ahayzen> damn\n<balloons> ahayzen, does this install?\n<balloons> http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/a/autopkgtest/autopkgtest_3.1_all.deb\n<ahayzen> hmmm could try mounting device in KVM...\n<ahayzen> remember wht happened last time we tried to get a utopic autopilot thing on my machine ;) hehe\n<balloons> ahayzen, this isn't autopilot but :-)\n<ahayzen> balloons, i have a utopic VM i'll see if i can figure tht out\n<balloons> same warnings apply\n<balloons> i'm mostly curious on how simple a backport would be\n<ahayzen> balloons, the v3 one seems to depend on less packages :)\n<ahayzen> balloons, http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/autopkgtest vs http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/autopkgtest\n * ahayzen senses many many many updates for his VM\n<balloons> ahayzen, well I'm off to finish tomorrow. I have a few questions, but I left an MP.\n * ahayzen has lost the ability to use bzr \"no support schemes\" :'( \n<ahayzen> balloons, oh u renamed ur branch :P\n<balloons> ahayzen, yea, lol, sorry\n<ahayzen> balloons, i thought i was going totally mental....like surely i can branch something i'm not tht sleepy yet\n<ahayzen> balloons, hmm can't build the click\n<balloons> ahayzen, ohh why not?\n<ahayzen> balloons, says 'INTLTOOL_MERGE-NOTFOUND: not found'\n<balloons> ahayzen, check the depends in debian/control\n<balloons> you are missing some build depends\n<ahayzen> then lots of recipe for target failed\n<ahayzen> hehe mediascanner2 was missing :)\n<ahayzen> oh no still failing...\n<nik90_> ahayzen: do sudo apt-get install intltool for the missing intltool\n<ahayzen> nik90_, ah yes it is going now\n<ahayzen> balloons, ah bum nexus appears over MTP in virtual machine but not adb\n<balloons> ahayzen, ohh well. I'm sure there's a way to fix, but I've got a dog to walk\n<balloons> I may play a bit more tomorrow before merging\n<balloons> ttyl\n<ahayzen> balloons, o/ have fun\n<balloons> btw, this shouldn't have any effect on the current method for running tests\n<balloons> nik90_, are you on utopic?\n<ahayzen> cool\n<DanChapman> nik90_, right so Dekko built and ran fine on device. So I definately don't think it's a QtC issue. And I can't see anything suspicious with the current clock cmake atm. I'll carry on tackling this in the morning. I need some sleep :-)\n<nik90_> balloons: nope on trusty. same as ahayzen...I am running a vm for 14.10 that I use for development\n<balloons> ahh.. no worries.. you'll be getting an mp for this too tomorrow\n<nik90_> DanChapman: thnx for confirming..have a good nite\n<ahayzen> damn kvm why you no adb :(\n<ahayzen> nik90_, have you ever used SortFilterModel ?\n<DanChapman> nik90_, quick question, is it a requirement you launch using qmlscene or can I try something else using a QQuickView?\n<nik90_> ahayzen: nope not yet\n<nik90_> DanChapman: I am not sure actually\n<nik90_> DanChapman: I think either way we would specify it in the desktop exec line\n<nik90_> ahayzen: hey are you able to use the VM to run apps on a device? I dare not try running an emulator inside a vm. And my VM doesn't seem to recognize the phone attached to my host os\n<ahayzen> nik90_, mine sees the device but only mtp not adb :(\n<ahayzen> nik90_, not sure how adb would appear in KVM? usb/network host?\n<nik90_> ahayzen: :/...I hate that I need my trusty to do device testing and the vm for coding..so inefficient\n<nik90_> ahayzen: I am not sure...for me under usb, it says no devices detected..which is why I asked\n<ahayzen> nik90_, you code in a VM :S\n<ahayzen> nik90_, what vm are you using?\n<nik90_> ahayzen: yeah cause I need the latest sdk package since trusty has been dropped officially\n<nik90_> ahayzen: virtual box vm 14.10\n<ahayzen> nik90_, ah i just code and then run on device to test .... have you added urself to the group so it can see usb devices?\n<nik90_> ahayzen: in my host device or the vm?\n<ahayzen> nik90_, host\n<nik90_> ahayzen: nope,\n * nik90_ tries\n<ahayzen> nik90_, IIRC https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/USB\n<nik90_> ahayzen: bah..You HAVE to logout/login from your session, NOT just restart Virtual Box, after the group change. .. :P\n<ahayzen> nik90_, yep and you are using the full VB no the OSE right?\n<nik90_> ahayzen: hmm..I installed virtualbox from the archives ...not sure\n<ahayzen> ah\n<nik90_> ahayzen: it says Oracle VM Virtual Box Manager\n<nik90_> ahayzen: am I using the full VB?\n<ahayzen> nik90_, IIRC the one in the archives doesn't have USB support 'The first thing you need to do is install Virtualbox from Oracle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website. It is different than Virtualbox OSE which is included in the Ubuntu repositories because the Virtualbox from Oracle includes proprietary software which allows you to mount USB devices inside you VM among other things. If you already have Virtualbox OSE installed from the Ub\n<ahayzen> untu repositories, uninstall it before installing the .deb file from Oracle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website.'\n<ahayzen> nik90_, but this was back in the VB 3.x days it may have changed now lol\n<nik90_> ahayzen: would I need to create the vm again? or are they compatible?\n<ahayzen> nik90_, http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31726/mount-usb-devices-in-virtualbox-with-ubuntu/\n<ahayzen> nik90_, 'Note: Any VMs you made with Virtualbox OSE will still work with the standard version of Virtualbox. Uninstall Virtualbox OSE before installing virtualbox from Oracle.'\n<nik90_> ahayzen: I don't want to take the risk of losing this...I spent too much time setting it\n<ahayzen> nik90_, yeah :/\n<ahayzen> nik90_, there is probably a more upto date article somewhere that one just appeared near the top of google\n<nik90_> ahayzen: thnx\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2014-07-08\n<daker> hi t1mp\n<dholbach> good morning\n<nhaines> dholbach: good morning!\n<nhaines> Thanks for approving my app update.  :)\n<dholbach> hey nhaines\n<dholbach> no worries :)\n<nhaines> The hard part was figuring out why it has broken in trusty on up.  But once that nut was cracked, it's nice to get a quick update (especially since the icon and screenshots updated immediately.)\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: Good morning. Your suggestion helped fix bug 1338807\n<ubot5> bug 1338807 in qtcreator-plugin-ubuntu \"Cannot run or install application on devices and emulator\" [Undecided,Invalid] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1338807\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: thought so , so i close the bug?\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: I marked it as invalid since it was a local issue on my machine\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: awesome thx :)\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: just a heads up, I can no longer stop an application by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F12. However I am able to close the application by closing it manually on the phone. Although I get a deprecated warning http://paste.ubuntu.com/7764259/\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: yes i know about the deprecated warning\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: ah ok\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: i will make it go away but i need to make sure it will work on older device images as well\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: I was just bringing it to your attention. If it is already in your radar, fine by me :)\n<zbenjamin> ;)\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: always throw issues at me if you have some :)\n<nik90_> :)\n<mihir> balloons: ping !!\n<mihir> balloons: did we got anyway we can run autopilots on trusty ?\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: hey if you have some time could you take a look at https://code.launchpad.net/~jpakkane/ubuntu-clock-app/utopiccmake/+merge/225694 and provide a code diff? We are unable to get past the \"unable to open desktop file for reading issue\".\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: just looking at it\n<nik90_> ah\n<JamesTait> Good morning all; happy SCUD Day! :-D\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: can you start the app on the device? for me it seems like the desktop file is named com.ubuntu.clock.desktop instead of ubuntu-clock-app.desktop\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: I cannot run it on the device..the manifest file reads ubuntu-clock-app.desktop\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: hence I renamed the desktop file to com.ubuntu.clock.desktop and tried running\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: yes, but your cmake file creates a com.ubuntu.clock.desktop\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: when I try to run on device, I get http://paste.ubuntu.com/7764433/\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: which shows it receiving a failed event when trying to start the application. not sure what that failure that means\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7764452/\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: that made it start on the desktop, on the device i get (process:10496): dconf-CRITICAL **: unable to create file '/run/user/32011/dconf/user': Permission denied.  dconf will not work properly.\n<popey> dholbach: can you please review https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/click-apps/90/changerequest/ ?\n<popey> dholbach: ignore me, you already did\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: hmm\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: maybe a missing policy?\n<dholbach> popey, anytime :)\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: I think I may be missing the \"calendar\" policy since i use alarms\n<popey> hah\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: yes, now it runs\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: if you try on your device i would suggest to change the app id while you work on it\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: otherwise your default clock application might get broken\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: yeah I will do that..\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: when the new qtcreator-ubuntu-plugin hits the archive, would removing the PPA suffice or would I have to purge the packages from the ppa and reinstall from archive?\n<zbenjamin> bzoltan: ^^\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  the first step will be to release the new QtC and the plugins to the SDK PPA. Releasing it to the LTS with and SRU is a bigger job.\n<zbenjamin> bzoltan: i think he has the tools-development ppa\n<zbenjamin> nik90_: you use the sdk ppa normally right?\n<bzoltan> nik90_: zbenjamin: ohh.. the tools-development should be purged\n<nik90_> bzoltan: yeah I was referring to the tools-development ppa and also in a 14.10 VM\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: yeah I use the sdk ppa normally\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  the tools-development will have the experimental stuff .. kind of unstable SDK for beta testing\n<nik90_> bzoltan: ah ok..so I will purge the ppa once the new releases hit the archive in 14.10 and continue normally\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  I would purge it when the new release hits the SDK PPA.. landing to the Trusty archive will take some time I am afraid..\n<DanChapman> nik90_, morning :-) so you have it working now?\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  I think one problem with the utopiccmake branch of the clock app is that the desktop.in file has wrong name. The manifest file states that the desktop file is  ubuntu-clock-app.desktop but the app folder has the com.ubuntu.clock.desktop.in\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  I think the project needs some name syncing and then it will work\n<bzoltan> nik90_: zbenjamin: I am afraid that some tools get confused with the ubuntu-clock-app vs. com.ubuntu.clock names\n<zbenjamin> bzoltan: yes, i told nik90_ how he can run the project and i work on a way to make the desktop finding for local projects more stable\n<bzoltan> zbenjamin:  working on it means that I should wait for a fix before this release?\n<zbenjamin> bzoltan: what i will do is: ask the manifest file in the project dir for the name of the desktop and search it in the builddir and project dir, if i cannot find it  i use the hookname as base for the desktop file name, if i cannot find that i use the project name and then fail if there is still nothing\n<zbenjamin> bzoltan: code is ready i'm testing it now\n<bzoltan> zbenjamin:  that makes sense\n<bzoltan> zbenjamin:  take my money and gimme the code! :D I want it ..\n<zbenjamin> bzoltan: i will push it to one of the 2 branches in the SIlo\n<mihir> popey: ping\n<bzoltan> zbenjamin:  cooool\n<popey> mihir: pong\n<mihir> popey:  could you confirm the other scenario i commented it on device ?\n<mihir> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-calendar-app/+bug/1338956\n<ubot5> Ubuntu bug 1338956 in Ubuntu Calendar App \"Date/time changer hidden when textfields have focus\" [Medium,New]\n * popey looks\n<popey> mihir: left a comment\n<mihir> popey: thanks :)\n<nik90_> zbenjamin: cool!\n<zbenjamin> bzoltan: its in the manifesttest branch, have fun ;)\n<nik90_> bzoltan: yeah I realised that..zbenjamin sent me a code diff to get it working on the device\n<nik90_> DanChapman: Good morning :-)\n<nik90_> DanChapman: yeah after making a couple of changes, it seems to be working\n<nik90_> DanChapman: I am going to create a new branch and do some testing and if they are ready, I will propose a MP\n<nik90_> DanChapman: good lord, the new clock app looks terrible on the device\n * nik90_ got lot of work to do\n<DanChapman> nik90_, hehe :-) yes there is quite a difference isn't there\n<popey> nik90_: terrible how?\n<nik90_> popey: as in the background image is not placed correctly and the animation is incorrect\n<nik90_> popey: my development fault..not the design :)\n<nik90_> DanChapman: :)\n<DanChapman> ouch! 50% CPU usage just viewing my inbox and leaving it open, spikes to 100 as soon as I start scrolling.

Cause in app/CMakelist.txt, this is done for the .desktop.in file as well\n<nik90_> DanChapman: may be you might know this ^^\n<nik90_> https://code.launchpad.net/~nik90/ubuntu-clock-app/fix-click-packaging/+merge/225946\n<DanChapman> nik90_, ahh yes i've seen that. From what i make of it QtC looks at manifest.json to determine how to execute it. You do no actually need the .in extension in order to configure it. I ended up just leaving it as manifest.json to work round it\n<nik90_> DanChapman: but when I put variables such as @PROJECT_NAME@, they are not replaced with the proper values during build\n<nik90_> DanChapman: they stay as @PROJECT_NAME@ instead of ubuntu-clock-app for instance\n<nik90_> DanChapman: nevermind you were right..so I did configure_file(manifest.json ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/manifest.json) without renaming it to manifest.json.in\n<DanChapman> nik90_, :-D do you use the bzr revno in the manifest? if so it might be worth sticking configure_file inside an add_custom_command() so it get's configured on each build and you always have up to date bzr revno\n<nik90_> DanChapman: yup I am using bzr revno in the manifest\n<rpadovani> oSoMoN, thanks for all your suggestions for reminders, and for the workaround :-)\n<rpadovani> mzanetti, if you want to take a look: https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/reminders-app/upgradeToOxide/+merge/225737\n<oSoMoN> rpadovani, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re welcome, thanks for filing the bug in the first place!\n<mzanetti> oSoMoN: yeah, thanks a lot for helping out!\n<oSoMoN> rpadovani, note that I\u00c2\u00a0submitted a fix for oxide, hopefully it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s merged soon and makes it into version 1.1.1\n<rpadovani> oSoMoN, cool!\n<mzanetti> rpadovani: quite busy atm... will review it later, maybe only tomorro\n<mzanetti> w\n<rpadovani> ok, see you tomorrow then :-)\n<rpadovani> balloons, o/ Could you help me to undestand what's wrong with this Jenkins failure?\n<rpadovani> https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/ubuntu-calculator-app/1333201/+merge/225874/comments/544686\n<popey> rpadovani: just re-triggered then noticed (pending - Jenkins is about to shut down )\n<popey> rpadovani: will take a look when it comes back\n<rpadovani> thanks\n<mterry> Anyone work on the UITK here?

I made sure that the cmake, manifest and desktop file name point to ubuntu-clock-app.desktop\n<nik90_> bzoltan: :)\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  you rock!\n<nik90_> bzoltan: I just did the finishing touches..most of it was done by zbenjamin, jussi and help from you and DanChapman\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  in the meantime I have a release candidate with a more tolerant run/packaging logic\n<nik90_> bzoltan: awesome\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  Yes :) I know. I have spent  some hours today on figuring out what should we do and what should the app do... I think we have a good compromise\n<nik90_> bzoltan: looking forward to it\n<bzoltan> nik90_: good to go http://picpaste.com/clock-pm4MxUiE.png\n<nik90_> bzoltan: https://plus.google.com/113051860352311525753/posts/aw7WDck2Wrr :)\n<nik90_> bzoltan: I just need to do one more thing before merging it. I want to introduce variables like @BZR_REVNO@ to the manifest.json file to ensure that the version is automatically updated.\n<nik90_> bzoltan: I will have a go at it tomorrow\n<bzoltan> nik90_: I push this QtC plugin release thru the CI and push an update to the tools-development PPA for trusty testing\n<bzoltan> nik90_: good job! thank you!\n<nik90_> bzoltan: yeah sure, I have the PPA installed, will test it\n<elopio> kenvandine: ping again, about testing the content hub.\n<kenvandine> hey elopio\n<elopio> kenvandine: hello! Let me tell you about our scenario and then you can decide if you want to run away :)\n<kenvandine> sure ;)\n<kenvandine> elopio, i'm running out to lunch in about 10m or so :)\n<kenvandine> but i won't be running away from you\n<elopio> kenvandine: rhuddie is writing tests for the address book + gallery integration. We have a test at a really high level that will open the address book, click the contact picture, select a picture from the gallery picker and get back to the addres book.\n<elopio> but we want a lower level to get faster feedback that what we would get with this one.\n<elopio> so we are trying to test the address book in isolation.\n<elopio> we have two options:\n<elopio> 1. use a fake content hub dbus service, and check that when we click the picture, the right messages are sent to the content hub.\n<kenvandine> so what you want is something on the service side that responds to the request without actually opening the gallery\n<elopio> 2. use a test peer that will communicate to the address book during our test.\n<elopio> kenvandine: right.\n<kenvandine> i wonder if we could have a test peer that has no UI\n<kenvandine> just automatically charges the transfer\n<kenvandine> and exits\n<elopio> kenvandine: that would be the perfect #2 option.\n<elopio> so, we started with option #1 because option #2 is testing too much of the content hub\n<kenvandine> i prefer testing more of the hub itself :)\n<elopio> but now we have half of the service and there are too many methods to implement and it's becoming hard to read.\n<kenvandine> blurred lines of integration testing :)\n<kenvandine> yeah... it'll be hard to maintain as well\n<kenvandine> another 3rd option\n<kenvandine> add a test mode to the hub\n<kenvandine> so when run in test mode\n<kenvandine> it automatically charges import requests\n<kenvandine> etc\n<elopio> kenvandine: yes, we found the hard way :) As content-hub is a direct dependency of address book, it wouldn't be that bad to fully excercise it during the autopilot tests.\n<elopio> kenvandine: oh, that would be magic.\n<kenvandine> it would...\n<kenvandine> but, personally i'd like the integration tests to test more of the hub\n<elopio> no need to maintain the test peer either. It would be like an integrated test peer.\n<kenvandine> i know isolation can be good for just testing the address-book\n<kenvandine> but if we exercise the hub it would help find hub bugs... which is otherwise hard to test\n<elopio> kenvandine: so you vote for option #2? rhuddie: sounds good?\n<kenvandine> that's my vote :)\n<kenvandine> option 3 is my second pick\n<elopio> kenvandine: we still can add a lower level test in addition to this one, for fast feedback without using the content hub\n<kenvandine> but more work\n<rhuddie> elopio, kenvandine, #2 sounds great. We would obviously need to configure the hub in test mode whilst running our test\n<elopio> that would be QML, just checking that we call the right content hub declarative.\n<elopio> rhuddie: that's option #3.\n<kenvandine> but since the hub has no UI, integration testing of the service relies on apps like this\n<elopio> option #2 is the test peer without UI that just replies with a picture.\n<kenvandine> the test peer could just see a transfer request for a picture and immediate charge it with  a picture\n<kenvandine> it could handle all the types\n<kenvandine> and even multiples\n<rhuddie> yes, #2 sounds ideal for what we need\n<kenvandine> if ContentType.SelectionType is multiple, it could charge it with several\n<kenvandine> etc\n<elopio> kenvandine: do you have some time to help us with this test peer?\n<kenvandine> and it helps test the hub, which is not well tested atm\n<kenvandine> i think so\n<kenvandine> bfiller, mind if i spend some time this week on that?\n<kenvandine> after the move stuff the music-app needs?\n<kenvandine> i think it could be  a big win for testing :)\n<elopio> kenvandine: it will be. You will earn a sticker with a smiley face from QA to wear proudly during the next sprint :D\n<elopio> kenvandine: last thing before you go to launch. We also discussed a little about seeding some autopilot tests for the examples on the content hub.\n<elopio> would that be useful for you?\n<kenvandine> i love stickers :)\n<kenvandine> seeding?\n<kenvandine> adding autopilot tests using my examples?\n<elopio> kenvandine: yes, seeding is adding two or three initial tests to show devs how to make more, and help them when they want to add more.\n<kenvandine> that would be awesome :)\n<kenvandine> and much appreciated\n<elopio> good. I'll see if we can schedule somebody to write them next week. I think I'll have time.\n<elopio> kenvandine: you have been really useful. Thanks. Lets wait for bfiller.\n<kenvandine> cool\n * kenvandine likes being useful\n<kenvandine> i should be able to do it\n<rhuddie> elopio, kenvandine, thanks a lot\n<kenvandine> elopio, your first use case is testing selecting a photo for addressbook right?\n<elopio> kenvandine: yes.\n<kenvandine> address book also shares contacts\n<kenvandine> but i guess that's the other direction :)\n<kenvandine> for now... i don't think sharing vcard over mms has landed yet\n<kenvandine> then we'll need the test peer to provide a vcard\n<kenvandine> i'll start with a photo, and we can add more later\n<elopio> kenvandine: brendand is close to that scenario, working on the integration of messaging app and address book. So we will be bothering you often.\n<elopio> you had your chance to run\n<kenvandine> haha\n<kenvandine> it won't be hard\n<kenvandine> and i'm excited about getting the hub tested more\n<kenvandine> it's a tough thing to test by itself\n<kenvandine> we have unit tests\n<kenvandine> so this will be very useful :)\n<kenvandine> ok, i'm heading to lunch... bbiab\n<elopio> buen provecho.\n<rpadovani> popey, there is a user that is a couple of weeks that spams on a lot of bugs on lp. THere is nothing you can do? :-)\n<kenvandine> rpadovani, i'm stepping away, but would love to hear about your first experiences with bacon2d\n<rpadovani> kenvandine, I'll be more precise on next days but....\n<popey> rpadovani: yeah, i just saw that myself\n<rpadovani> fucking awesome :-)\n<popey> haha\n<kenvandine> rpadovani, sweet... well feedback is welcome :)\n * kenvandine really leaves now\n<rpadovani> kenvandine, see you, and thasnk :-)\n<elopio> ping artmello. Can I bring your attention to this branch?\n<elopio> https://code.launchpad.net/~rhuddie/gallery-app/add-photos-page-object/+merge/225962\n<bfiller> kenvandine: should be fine\n<dholbach> beuno, can scope authors specify screenshots and icons and will they be used anywhere?\n<beuno> dholbach, yes, in the scopes scope\n<dholbach> ok cool\n<ogra_> DanChapman, so i tested your new click ... but i get an error pop up that is sadly cut off on the sides\n<ogra_> DanChapman, starting the app newly works without error but the last message in my inbox is still from saturday\n * ogra_ wonders what to delete in his homedir to make sure to start afresh\n<dholbach> beuno, do we basically tell folks to \"click build .\"\n<dholbach> ?\n<dholbach> beuno, or is there something in the SDK to do it\n<dholbach> ?\n<DanChapman> ogra_ :-(. If you wipe the config ~/.config/com.ubuntu.developer.dpniel.dekko/ it will destroy & recreate the the cache on setting up again\n<ogra_> ok\n<ogra_> i tried a bunch of the former troijita clicks, perhaps there is some mess left over\n<dpm> popey, on the next file manager app meeting (or perhaps in e-mail), could you remind the guys to review each other's branches? This would take 3 MRs off the red and orange list\n<DanChapman> ogra_, what imap server/service do you use? I've tried that click on loads of different ones today (dovecot, cyrus, gmail, hotmail and exchange) and they all worked reasonably well, bar gmail but thats a braindead server anyway :-)\n<ogra_> dovecot in my LAN\n<artmello> elopio: i removed the skip on this MR: https://code.launchpad.net/~artmello/gallery-app/gallery-app-reenable_AP_test/+merge/225978\n<artmello> elopio: but it seems to fail on Jenkins\n<artmello> elopio: probably we need the changes on the MR you mentioned\n<dholbach> dpm, kyleN, mhall119, popey: do you know if there's anything in the SDK which lets me write and package a scope as a click, or would I have to just \"click build .\"?=\n<dholbach> sorry, just run \"click build .\"\n<dpm> dholbach, there is not yet support for click packaging in the SDK's scopes templates IIRC\n<kyleN> dholbach, I took a hard look recently at pkging scopes to click.\n<popey> i do not\n<beuno> dholbach, I don't know how they are built\n<dpm> zbenjamin, do you know? ^\n<kyleN> one can build them.\n<elopio> artmello: thanks! rhuddie will be helping you getting it to stable.\n<dholbach> ok, so \"click build .\" it is\n<dholbach> that'll take some more doc writing then\n<kyleN> what I do is use the SDK cross building to create the arch specific .so file and etc (that's Cmake and Build in the IDE)\n<kyleN> then I run  script to create tmy clickdir with the contents and structure I want, grabbing files from the source dir and the build dir as needed\n<kyleN> then I click build clickdir\n<ogra_> DanChapman, ok, i wiped everything and started over ... lets see if it updates once i get a new mail :)\n<dholbach> thanks kyleN\n<dholbach> beuno, dpm: so that's a bit more than \"just take the 'publish app' docs\" then\n<kyleN> dholbach, yw.\n<dpm> dholbach, yes, the existing scope templates in the SDK need to add support for packaging, essentially\n<dholbach> until then I guess I'll need to write something up\n<ogra_> DanChapman, hmm, i sent myself a test mail and it showed up ... that looks a lot better, i guess the old crift i had around might have caused the issue\n<ogra_> hmm\n<nik90_> ogra_: oops sent you an email :P\n<ogra_> but it doesnt like to show me the content of that mail\n<ogra_> i wonder if thats due to my gpg signature\n<ogra_> argh\n<ogra_> now it doesnt show my inbox content but the inbox subfolders instead\n<ogra_> nik90_, heh, thanks ... but i only see it on my laptop\n<nik90_> :)\n<ogra_> seems i'm back to the state where it doesnt update anymore\n<DanChapman> ogra_, clicking on the progression arrow shows the subfolders. Click anywhere else and it opens the maillist for that mailbox.\n<DanChapman> darn so it's done it again\n<ogra_> ah\n<ogra_> thats pretty cool !\n<ogra_> (if you know about it ... )\n<ogra_> aha\n<ogra_> \"y108 BAD Error in IMAP command SELECT: Invalid QRESYNC parameters\"\n<ogra_> thats what i see in the log\n<ogra_> yup, every time i tap on the reload button this line appears\n<DanChapman> yeah it's the not the clearest of ways to navigate the mailbox tree. Ideas welcome :-)\n<DanChapman> Ahh great that gives me something to work on\n<dholbach> dpm, zbenjamin, kyleN: do you know if there's a bug open for making the \"package my scope\" workflow happen in qtcreator?\n<kyleN> dholbach, sorry, not sure.\n<dpm> dholbach, not that I know of.\n<kenvandine> bfiller, cool\n<DanChapman> ogra_, could you try wiping just the cache under ~/.cache/com.ubuntu.developer.dpniel/dekko.\n<ogra_> done\n<ogra_> same error\n<dholbach> dpm, kyleN, zbenjamin: filed 1339237\n<dpm> bug 1339237\n<kyleN> great!\n<ubot5> bug 1339237 in qtcreator-plugin-ubuntu \"Publishing scopes should be as easy as it is for apps\" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1339237\n<dpm> thanks dholbach\n<dholbach> dpm, beuno: udpated developer.u.c/publish/ with some very simple and preliminary content on how to publish scopes - I'll start a conversation with all related teams to improve it together - this should be a team effort\n<dpm> thanks dholbach!\n<beuno> dholbach, sweet, thank you\n<dholbach> dpm, I'll mention the mail you just sent\n<dpm> awesome\n<DanChapman> ogra_, if possible could you try one last thing for me in ~/.config/com.ubuntu.developer.dpniel.dekko/com.ubuntu.developer.dpniel.dekko.conf could you add, \"imap.capabilities.blacklist=QRESYNC\" and see if that resolves it. I need to implement some kind of logging to better address this further, but hopefully that should get it working for you temporarily\n<ogra_> DanChapman_afk, that seems to help\n<daker> yo popey\n<daker> or mhall119\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, t1mp, has the new SDK header stuff landed yet?\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: looking at the ui-toolkit trunk it seems so\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, hmmm so should jenkins be failing with this? http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/generic-mediumtests-utopic/927/testReport/junit/music_app.tests.test_music/TestMainWindow/test_add_song_to_queue_from_albums_page_with_mouse_/\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, specifically 'PageHeadState is not a type'\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: it shouldn't be technically..I will have to check in my utopic vm if the update has landed though\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, ah yes good plan... i'll check as well\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, so what are you doing about the trusty coreapps PPA now? as the app won't run on trusty?\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: we cant do much :/\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, :( no way of gettting it to run on trusty? i guess it would need qt5.3 as well...not as simple as before where someone could just copy the uitk packages over\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: exactly...Qt 5.3 is required and I dont think they have the time to backport it\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, no damn so guess we'll have to turn off the recipes for trusty then\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, my utopic machine says there is a 07/07 build so jenkins should have got that?\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: it should be 0.1.48+14.10.20140707-0ubuntu1 so yes\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: I am not sure about jenkins though\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: may be it hasnt been updated\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: I got a small issue. I am using the QML FolderListModel to show the ringtones folder. However on the phone it appears empty while on the desktop it works as expected. I ensured that the package is installed on the phone\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, if you go to system-settings and then click on the ringtones do they play for u?\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, they haven't been working for me in the recent images\n * nik90_ checks now\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, maybe that is part of the issue\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: yeah I don't hear it either\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: but that shouldn't be a reason for not displaying the files either?\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: or perhaps it is a permission issue?\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, unless they have moved... or more likely that :)\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: nah, I checked the filesystem manually. They are in the folder I specified\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, so permissions then?\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, who are the files owned by?\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: not sure\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, what is the output of a ls -l on the folder?\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: root\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, thats the issue\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: but I am only reading the folder and not writing into it\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, we had music files not playing when they were root ... try changing them to phablet and see wht happens\n<anti_> hi guts\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: I tried sudo chown -R phablet Ubuntu.ogg\n<nik90_> ahayzen_: however it says it is a read-only system\n<nik90_> for some reason\n<ahayzen_> nik90_, ah u may have to make it writable to modify the files but these should probably be readable by default\n<nik90_> true\n<nik90_> I will check with seb128 to see if the system settings apps not being able to play ringtones is an issue\n * nik90_ needs to reboot his system\n<ahayzen_> cool\n<Diogo_> hi\n<Diogo_> some one out there??\n<Diogo_> guys need some help plzz\n<Diogo_> ??\n<Diogo_> some one??\n<Diogo_> ??\n<Diogo_> ??\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2014-07-09\n<Diogo_> hi\n<Diogo_> some one here??\n<Diogo_> need some help pozz\n<Diogo_> plzz\n<Diogo_> ??\n<Diogo_> ??\n<Diogo_> ??\n<Diogo_> ??\n<Diogo_> some one??\n<Diogo_> ??\n<mhall119> daker: late reply, but what's up?\n<daker> mhall119: check pm\n<dholbach> good morning\n<dpm> dholbach, morning!

About some of the files not specifying a copyright year, is it ok to leave the year blank in debian/copyright?\n<dholbach> yes, just copy whatever the file is saying\n<dpm> ok\n<JamesTait> Good morning all; happy Sugar Cookie Day! :-D\n<rio094> test\n<ogra_> failed\n<brendand> popey, i just opened two bugs, one for the sudoku app failure and another for calendar app failures. can someone have a look at them?\n<popey> thanks brendand\n<popey> brendand: links?\n<brendand> popey, oh yeah - links!\n<brendand> they're useful for finding things...\n<brendand> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-calendar-app/+bug/1339627\n<ubot5> Ubuntu bug 1339627 in Ubuntu Calendar App \"test_fill_form and test_add_new_event_with_default_values failed on mako image #120\" [Undecided,New]\n<brendand> https://bugs.launchpad.net/sudoku-app/+bug/1339616\n<ubot5> Ubuntu bug 1339616 in Sudoku App \"test_profiles fails on mako image #120\" [Undecided,New]\n<popey> ta\n<popey> brendand: so, my question still stands from the call, why were these two not found when the uitk landing was tested?\n<brendand> popey, i'm the wrong person to ask - i didn't have anything to do with the landing\n<brendand> popey, and i have the same question\n<popey> true.\n<brendand> Mirv, can we try and figure out why these regressions got in? for the sake of making the process watertight\n<Mirv> brendand: I've already poked sdk team regarding the sudoku/calendar timeouts so they can try to figure out how/if uitk could cause those\n<Mirv> brendand: popey: sdk team didn't see those errors when validating the release locally. so it's the difference in local vs image testing\n<brendand> Mirv, which funnily some members of my team are trying to convince me isn't necessary, as 'all issues should be seen locally also'\n<brendand> Mirv, let's not say it's to do with the CI system though as i can reproduce them here just fine (on my own mako)\n<nik90_> t1mp: ping\n<Mirv> brendand: over time a lot of things haven't been seen locally, but if you do now see these please ping zoltan (he was also flashing 121 in order to retest with that)\n<t1mp> nik90_: hello\n<nik90_> t1mp: Hi, I just moved the new clock app to the new header api. It seems more cleaner\n<nik90_> t1mp: I did have one grief about it though\n<nik90_> t1mp: In the PageHeadConfiguration doc, where you provide actions, backAction and contents, why is it that while using actions and backAction we specify head.actions and head.backAction\n<nik90_> while for contents, we just use it as contents?\n<bzoltan> nik90_: popey: I am just about to release the brand new QtC3.1.1 with the latest plugins. I would need few volunteers to try it out with their projects.\n<nik90_> bzoltan: wasn't that the one in the PPA already?\n<bzoltan> nik90_: Here https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/+archive/ubuntu/tools-development\n<bzoltan> nik90_: this is the the release candidate, I have not pushed it to the official release SDK PPA\n<nik90_> bzoltan: I already have that PPA on my trusty machine.. David planella made a call out on the mailing list asking for testers\n<nik90_> bzoltan: I have been using that PPA for the past 2 days\n<mihir> balloons: hi\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  I know :) I asked his help to hire testers\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  then a dist-upgrade will give you the latest\n<mihir> nik90_: are you on trusty or utopic?\n<nik90_> bzoltan: yes I was just conveying that I have been testing qtc 3.1.1 and it seems to be working fine\n<nik90_> mihir: My main laptop is running trusty. But I do my development on my Utopic VirtualBox VM\n<mihir> Hmm okay , nik90_ i guess i have to do the same, because autopilots not running on trusty\n<nik90_> mihir: yeah I suppose\n<t1mp> nik90_: uhm, let me check the docs :)\n<t1mp> nik90_: you mean in the example where I use contents: Rectangle { ... }\n<t1mp> nik90_: that's a mistake... should be head.contents, or head { contents: ... }\n<nik90_> t1mp: yeah\n<nik90_> t1mp: ah\n<t1mp> nik90_: you can group them with head { actions: [...]; backAction: Action { ... }; contents: Item { ... } }\n<nik90_> t1mp: Ideally I would also place backAction inside actions rather than outside it since backAction is essential a special kind of action\n<nik90_> since that's what we did with the old tools as well\n<t1mp> nik90_: yeah, but actions is now a simple list\n<nik90_> t1mp: true\n<t1mp> nik90_: I understand your reasoning, but we thought making actions a list is cleaner, and ideally backAction does not need to be set often (if you use Tabs or PageStack you automatically get a tabs button or back button there)\n<nik90_> t1mp: may I fix the examples bug? I was thinking of including the backAction example in the PageHeadConfiguration page itself since otherwise one needs to navigate back and forth between different pages to see the examples\n<t1mp> nik90_: yes, that would be great :) if you have an MR send it to me\n<nik90_> t1mp: agree\n<t1mp> nik90_: I was thinking that even an actions example can go in the PageHeadConfiguration docs\n<nik90_> t1mp: yup I agree as well\n<t1mp> (now there is only a small example in the Page docs)\n<nik90_> t1mp: when I edit the docs, how do I output it to see if it is formatted correctly or not?\n<nik90_> t1mp: I branched the staging and opened the .qmlproject in qtcreator.\n<t1mp> nik90_: qmake && make docs\n<t1mp> nik90_: that will create a documentation/html/ with the html files inside\n<nik90_> t1mp: ah\n<nik90_> t1mp: in the head.actions definitions, why do you provide text: i18n.tr(\"Search\") ? Do they show up as tooltips?\n<t1mp> nik90_: they show up in the actions overflow popover (if you have more than 3 actions)\n<t1mp> nik90_: the action buttons don't show any text right now, I need to check with the designers if there should be a tooltip or similar\n<nik90_> t1mp: oops, I need to fix that then in the clock app as well :)\n<t1mp> brendand: did you reproduce https://bugs.launchpad.net/sudoku-app/+bug/1339616 on a pc or local device or only CI?\n<ubot5> Ubuntu bug 1339616 in Sudoku App \"test_profiles fails on mako image #120\" [Undecided,New]\n<nik90_> t1mp: where can I find page.qdoc?\n<nik90_> t1mp: the page documentation doesn't seem to be at Page10.qml or Page11.qml\n<brendand> t1mp, it was on the local device\n<brendand> t1mp, the problem is the keyboard gets in the way of the save button\n<t1mp> brendand: oh, did some default behavior change there?\n<brendand> t1mp, i haven't tested the old behaviour yet\n<mterry> bzoltan, can you answer some questions about the interaction of Dialogs and the OSK?\n<bzoltan> mterry:  let me try\n<bzoltan> t1mp: ^\n<mterry> bzoltan, so I'm looking at the ubuntu-system-settings page for setting a password\n<mterry> bzoltan, it pops up a Dialog SDK element to get the new password and authenticate with the ol\n<mterry> d\n<mterry> bzoltan, but the OSK takes up a lot of the space and overlaps some of the elements of the dialog.\n<bzoltan> mterry: ahh... that one. We have seen this before\n<mterry> bzoltan, I tried to use anchorToKeyboard but maybe I didn't use it right?  Or does Dialog not use that key?\n<mterry> I mean, I set it on the MainView\n<t1mp> mterry, bzoltan seems like the same issue that we have now with sudoku-app and calendar\n<bzoltan> mterry: I am busy with an other projet but let me pull in t1mp who will help you\n<bzoltan> t1mp:  yes, that is exactly case there too\n<t1mp> mterry: I think the Dialog is not a child of the MainView, so it wouldn't help\n<mterry> t1mp, yeah I worried about that.  Is there no current solution for it?\n<mterry> t1mp, is there a bug for this yet?\n<t1mp> mterry: I think not, but two related bugs https://bugs.launchpad.net/sudoku-app/+bug/1339616 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-calendar-app/+bug/1339627\n<ubot5> Ubuntu bug 1339616 in Sudoku App \"test_profiles fails on mako image #120\" [Undecided,New]\n<ubot5> Ubuntu bug 1339627 in Ubuntu Calendar App \"test_fill_form and test_add_new_event_with_default_values failed on mako image #120\" [Undecided,New]\n<mterry> t1mp, OK.

What policy should I add to the clock app to be able to read that folder?\n<nik90_> jdstrand: going through http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/apps/security-policy-for-click-packages/, I don't see any policy that would satisfy this.\n<rpadovani> dpm, I'm in :-)\n<DanChapman> davmor2, Ahh yes that's generally what \"Mark all as read\" does :-D. Sorry about that :-( My intention is to have that further down the toolbar dropdown once some more actions are implemented. But I can see that may still happen quite often with a touch device. Do you think an additional confirmation step would make sense here?\n<dpm> yay! tty in a minute :)\n<davmor2> DanChapman: Yeah I think so :)\n<davmor2> DanChapman: other than that though I've not had many issues with it :)\n<ogra_> DanChapman, oh, not sure you catched my reply yesterday ... imap.capabilities.blacklist=QRESYNC helps a lot (there are still issues with the refresh button, but going back to the start page and then to inbox gets me a proper update)\n<DanChapman> davmor2, That's good to hear! ok cool i'll include that in the next update then :-)\n<DanChapman> ogra_, just seen it now. :-) brilliant, so I'm going to sort some proper logging for the IMAP conversation and try and narrow down why QRESYNC is having trouble.

It seems the temperature here is lower than in Stuttgart, surprisingly, but still sunny :)\n<dholbach> sometimes you better just stay at home :-)\n<nhaines> dholbach: it's like you're a hurricane, except of awesome, not destruction.  :)\n<dholbach> haha\n * dholbach hugs nhaines\n<dholbach> nhaines, how's life? how are you doing?\n<nhaines> Pretty good, dholbach.  Got asked to write an Ubuntu book proposal by a publisher I like but hadn't talked to before.  The only problem is that it's hard work.  ;)\n<dholbach> that's the problem with a lot of things in life, right? ;-)\n<dholbach> maybe you could team up with somebody else?\n<nhaines> dholbach: but then I'd have to split the advance!  ;)  I have a week to do it and they provided some free books that show similar ideas, so we'll see.  :)\n<dholbach> :)\n<justCarakas> soo what do you guys think about googles new ui ? http://www.polymer-project.org/components/paper-elements/demo.html\n<nhaines> Been using it for a week. It's beautiful.  I think it validates the origami-inspired Suru theme.\n<justCarakas> nhaines: do you think it will influence the suru theme ?\n<Saviq> dpm, that reminders + oxide error sounds like apparmor prevented you from running it\n<Saviq> dpm, I think you need to change the apparmor profile\n<dpm> Saviq, ah, well spotted. Is there a particular permission for oxide?\n<Saviq> dpm, there is one for webview IIRC\n<nhaines> justCarakas: not sure about that.  Maybe in a year or two.  But for now I think we're going to get what we see.  Or at least, what we see in two weeks since a lot of new things are landing.\n<Saviq> dpm, do you have the \"webview\" policy group enabled?\n<justCarakas> nhaines: fancy, looking foreward to it :)\n<justCarakas> gonne give a talk in a moth or so at our company about smartphones without android, ios or win mobile\n<dpm> Saviq, yeah, we've got \"webview\", but what I'm seeing is that we're using policy version 1.1, and I'm wondering if that's the right one\n<Saviq> dpm, looks right\n<justCarakas> probably gonne focus on firefox os and u touch\n<Saviq> dpm, can you see anything in \"sudo dmesg | grep DEN\" or \"grep DEN /var/log/syslog\"\n<dpm> let me try to run it again\n<Saviq> ah also /var/log/kern.log and /var/log/messages (/me never remembers where)\n<Saviq> yeah kern.log\n<dpm> ok\n<nhaines> justCarakas: tried to get Jono Bacon to admit to an Ubuntu smartwatch for a couple weeks.  No luck.  ;)\n<justCarakas> nhaines: hehe, well it would be nice, but first get ubuntu touch (or should I call it next :p) to a point where you can actually say to your neighbour hey, why don't you use this, its awesome\n<justCarakas> nhaines: and I'd rather first have the tetering option, and the ability to text from my laptop or browser, if that is in there, I'll probaby drop android in a heartbeat\n<nhaines> justCarakas: it's okay, for the fourth week Jono was at SCALE and during his massive Q&A session toward the end when it was just hardcore enthusiasts I got to ask him \"What is your favorite text editor, and why is it nano?\"\n<nhaines> Which got huge laughs, which was fun.  Also, turns out it really is nano.\n<justCarakas> haha :D\n<justCarakas> well when I'm in console I always use nano 2\n<dpm> Saviq, indeed, it's an apparmor denial: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7774025/\n<nhaines> justCarakas: tethering will come to Ubuntu (or not, I guess) independently of a smartwatch.  Hopefully sooner rather than later, since it requires hardware support.\n<justCarakas> nhaines: I know, but I think if they would no also start to focus on smartwatches things would slow down too much\n<popey> Ubuntu for Fridges!\n<dpm> oSoMoN, any ideas why I might be getting this oxide apparmor denials (http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7774025/) when trying to run the Reminders oxide branch in the emulator? https://code.launchpad.net/~rpadovani/reminders-app/upgradeToOxide/+merge/225737\n<nhaines> justCarakas: it's highly unlikely the design team are going to be working on tethering functionality though.  :)\n<justCarakas> nhaines: true, but it also needs an implementation\n<oSoMoN> dpm, yes, I just answered your e-mail\n<nhaines> Yeah, but those aren't going to be the same people doing the core apps (all community) or the UI toolkit either. :)\n<justCarakas> popey the internet of ubuntu things\n<nhaines> But I agree with you: one thing at a time, stay focused.\n<nhaines> Just as I tell people in /r/Ubuntu.\n<nhaines> Which I am now a mod off, which is weird.\n<dpm> oSoMoN, ah, thanks, I was looking at the wrong file, it seems we're missing that policy indeed\n<dpm> thanks oSoMoN, Saviq\n<justCarakas> i'm going to move out soon, and exept for the mac I use at work all my computers (I have a lot) run ubuntu, so I think I'll start tinkering then with making them \"talk\" to each other\n<nhaines> Nothing like samba and ssh.  :)\n<nhaines> Consider byobu if you do lots of commandline stuff!\n<justCarakas> nhaines: I'm not on the main channel, I'm just an ubuntu app dev wearing my fronteer t-shirt to work today :p\n<Saviq> dpm, cheers\n<justCarakas> also been thinking bout own cloud\n<dpm> oSoMoN, do you have a bug to track the backport of oxide 1.0.2 to trusty?\n<nhaines> justCarakas: my Pioneer shirt was black, not grey.\n<popey> very very dark grey\n<justCarakas> should look the bad voltage thing up again where they talked about that stuff if I remember correctly or it might also have been the ubuntu uk podcast, popey do you know (I think you should know :p)?\n<nhaines> I assumed it was because my webapp broke and I only got around to fixing it this week.  :P\n<oSoMoN> dpm, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so, feel free to file one\n<justCarakas> mine is also black, I'm glad it is :p\n<justCarakas> looks nicer on me\n<nhaines> Yes, but much warmer.  There's been a heatwave lately.\n<justCarakas> popey: dark gray is after washing it 100 times and walk a lot in the sun :p\n<justCarakas> nhaines: become a ubuntu pioneer, it keeps you warm (nice slogan)\n<oSoMoN> dpm, when that happens, that will actually be oxide 1.0.3, and for it to happen we have to wait until the 36.0.1985 branch of chromium becomes stable (next week IIRC)\n<dpm> oSoMoN, I'm happy to, but I've no idea of the plans, or who's working on it. The reason I'm asking is because we will probably need to wait for it to appear in trusty before we land that branch\n<dpm> I mean before we land the Reminders branch\n<dpm> as we have a Reminders .deb package that runs on trusty too\n<oSoMoN> dpm, if it has to run on trusty, then yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a blocker\n<JamesTait> Good morning all; happy Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Step On A Bee Day! :-D\n<kalikiana> JamesTait: that one is about protecting an endangered species, right? don't step on bees, they're struggling to survive already :-P\n<JamesTait> kalikiana, exactly! :)\n<popey> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ9VNbXUFpY  # BEES!\n<dpm> popey, core apps call?\n<Diogo_> hi\n<Diogo_> is some one out there, need some help plzz\n<dpm> Diogo_, please ask what exactly you need help with, and then someone can try to give you a hand if they can\n<popey> k\n<popey> !ask | Diogo_\n<ubot5> Diogo_: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience\n<Diogo_> so here is my question i have a propery var i would like to create a new  create var by doing for exemple t = q1.text + (q2.text/60) and then store that value and use later on to do for example i have another var like t and i want to multiplie x with t that create var Y divided by 1000 that create var k and to finish off k x 0.101 . is this possible??\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, it's a bit confusing but yes, is possible, you only have to create all these vars. What's your doubt?\n<rpadovani> dpm, I'll take a look to your comment to oxide MR later today\n<Diogo_> i just wanted to know if this whas possible, because thats the formula i have to make the calculation\n<justCarakas> Diogo_:  should be posible, sounds like basic math\n<Diogo_> to create the var t is it like this \"property var t : sumM + sumN\"??\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, it depends: if you want to create it as global qml var, yes. If you want to create in a Javascript function, you can use var t = sumM + sumN\n<Diogo_> i have joint all the values in those 2 vars\n<rpadovani> also, be careful. If you use property var t: sumM + sumN the value of t is set during the creation of the component, and it isn't update when sumM or sumN change\n<rpadovani> so, you can update t when you change sumN or sumM\n<rpadovani> or you can use something like onSumMChanged: t = sumM+sumN\n<Diogo_> rpadovani  and do i declare onSumMChanged  in the mainview ??\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, yap\n<Diogo_> because the useres are those who set the values\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, where do you declare sumM?\n<rpadovani> it has to be a QML var, not a Javascript one\n<Diogo_> i clare it as a proppery var in the main view and as i know it's a global right?\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, yes, then you can use onSumMChanged\n<Diogo_> there i join all the values from the textfields\n<dpm> rpadovani, awesome, thanks!\n<Diogo_> im asking this, because i have a school project and i want to delever the first energy consumption calculator of ubuntu phone\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtqml-syntax-objectattributes.html#property-change-signals\n<Diogo_> rpdadovani do i need to write property var to call onSumMChanged: t = sumM+sumN\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, yap, t has to be inizialized somewhere\n<Diogo_> so that means that first i need to write propery var t : sumM + sumN abd afterthat i can call onSumMChanged\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, you can simply declare t: property var t. You don't have to assign it a vaule\n<rpadovani> *value\n<Diogo_> i like to give it a value, so i dont lose my redenering\n<Diogo_> rpadovani can you look at my code to see if it's good?\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, sure, where is it?\n<Diogo_> can i paste it??\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, use paste.ubuntu.com\n<Diogo_> here is the link\n<Diogo_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7774513/\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, the problem with this code is that the value to property are assigned only on creation of the Component. A property doesn't change itself, you have to assign it the right value every time you change a value of one of the operators\n<Diogo_> and what can i do to update the property every time a user enters a value\n<Diogo_> because taht calcus is the price of the bill the user will pay at the end of the month\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, there are a lot of strategy. Probably the best is to create a function updateValues() that you call when the user change text in a textfield. Or when it press the \"=\" button\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, it depends if you want to update in only after an action from user (eg press \"=\" button) or if you want to update all values every time the user change one value\n<rpadovani> s/in/all values/g\n<Diogo_> i want to update it when the user presses the button\n<Diogo_> and if i needed to make that function where did i place it.\n<Diogo_> i'll send you my full code so that you can see what i have done if you dont mind\n<rpadovani> k\n<Diogo_> so that it would be easier for you to help me if you dont mind\n<rpadovani> ok\n<Diogo_> rpadovani here is the link http://paste.ubuntu.com/7774576/\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, so, first of all, you don't need to declare the value of properties. As I said, it takes value on creation, so it's 0\n<Diogo_> ok\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, then you can create a Button like this http://paste.ubuntu.com/7774607/\n<Diogo_> so i remove all those property vars from the mainfiew right?\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, no, you need to declare them\n<Diogo_> ok\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, but you don't need to assign them  a value\n<dpm> popey, I might join Music mid-meeting\n<Diogo_> like this http://paste.ubuntu.com/7774620/\n<Diogo_> ?\n<Diogo_> but if i do this it gives me an erroe\n<popey> dpm: the guys aren't here yet\n<dpm> ok\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, remove the ':'\n<Diogo_> ok done\n<Diogo_> and now rpadovani\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, and now what?\n<Diogo_> so it's done?\n<rpadovani> Diogo_, yes, when you click your botton, results are calculated\n<Diogo_> ok i'll check if all is working.\n<Diogo_> 2 mins\n<rpadovani> Launch time, see you\n<Diogo_> ok thnx rpadovani for your help\n<Diogo_> dpm\n<nik90_> t1mp_: I got the MP ready for the docs bug at https://code.launchpad.net/~nik90/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/improve-header-api-docs/+merge/226113\n<dholbach> dpm, when I'm back again, I'm happy to help looking at this again\n<dpm> awesome, thanks dholbach\n<dholbach> popey, copying qtkeychain from the sdk test ppa to the coreapps ppa worked - I'm now waiting for the trusty armhf build to succeed (https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-touch-coreapps-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/daily/+build/6162371) - looks like we'll be sorted for the daily builds\n<dholbach> it's a horrible workaround, but ... anyway ... profit! or something ;-)\n<popey> sweet!\n<popey> I think we're going to need to switch off daily builds for music app soon, as they're going to land things that need Qt5.3\n<popey> (trusty builds)\n<dholbach> yeah, that's sort of expected I guess\n<t1mp_> nik90_: great, thanks. I'll check it out!\n<nik90_> np\n<t1mp_> nik90_: approved :)\n<nik90_> t1mp_: wow..yay!\n<dholbach> popey, http://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis?order=field_popularity might be interesting - what do you think?\n<popey> handy!\n<davmor2> popey: dpm: Evernote account creation the email address field isn't using the email keyboard layout is that known?\n<Diogo_> hi guys\n<popey> davmor2: not sure we can do that\n<popey> its a 3rd party form\n<Diogo_> just a little question, how can i put a var to zerro when clicked on a button??\n<dpm> davmor2, indeed, it's a web page, and I don't think we can do much with it. But mardy_ would be the best person to ask probably\n<davmor2> popey: I guess we can let them know so they can fix it, I'm assuming that the password field is a standard text field too but I wasn't really paying attention to the keyboard at that point :)\n<DanChapman> Diogo_, you can just set it back to 0 from within the buttons onClicked slot\n<dpm> davmor2, please let us know if you spot anything else while testing Reminders, or feel free to report directly at https://bugs.launchpad.net/reminders-app/+filebug\n<Diogo_> DanChapman i dont know how to do that im a noob in qml\n<davmor2> dpm: I was actually just testing account creation rather than testing the app I just happened to notice it :)\n<Diogo_> i whas thinking in making an other button to set it to zerro, when clicked\n<dpm> davmor2, feel free to go ahead with the next step, the app is beautiful! :-)\n<Diogo_> an other question, how can i make a textfield to be used optional\n<DanChapman> Diogo_, so when a button is clicked it emits a clicked signal, so you can use that signal using the onClicked slot in side the button declaration, \"onClicked: yourVarName = 0\"\n<DanChapman> Diogo_, have you followed the tutorial on developer.ubuntu.com? it covers alot of the basics to get you going\n<Diogo_> i have kind off\n<Diogo_> and asked a lot to other people at askubuntu\n<Diogo_> here, and via the [ubuntu-Phone] mail list\n<balloons> popey et la, there is something funny it seems with jenkins core apps atm.. Not sure where fginther left it last night\n<Diogo_> DanChapman thanks for your help :)\n<fginther> balloons, popey, I didn't change anything last night. I ran an experiment, but it was a one off through a unique job\n<fginther> balloons, is something borked?\n<balloons> fginther, th eexperiment was just with py3 right?\n<dpm> thanks popey for the scopes list\n<fginther> balloons, yes, it was a test of music-app forcing it to use python3\n<dpm> balloons, elopio, I'm not sure you were on CC, but we're going ahead with adding reminders to the image\n<popey> fginther: we're getting no toolbar appearing on music and calendar tests, causing them to fail\n<fginther> new sdk release?\n<popey> they'd fail on ci daily images too then surely?\n<fginther> hmm, yes, I would expect it to fail there too\n<balloons> well, I'm concerned it's still running AP 1.4 and not ap 1.5, but it could also be something with the uitk.. I couldn't find the version it was using last night\n<balloons> but it was late\n<balloons> we can build trunk to confirm confirm something changed\n<Diogo_> dan\n<Diogo_> can i do this  t= sumhor + (summ /60)\n<balloons> here's the run from trunk fginther for music.. http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/generic-mediumtests-utopic/947/ It failed the same way\n<balloons> http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/music-app-ci/922/\n<DanChapman> Diogo_, yes aslong as you either have a \"property <type> t\" in your qml document or \"var t\" inside a javascript function\n<Diogo_> dan can i send you some code\n<Diogo_> because when i run it it says NaN, what does that mean??\n<Diogo__> if you dont mid\n<DanChapman> Diogo__, sure paste it somewhere and send me a link\n<Diogo__> ok thx :)\n<Diogo__> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7775453/\n<Diogo__> there is the code\n<DanChapman> Diogo__, ok so first question have you got sumquant, sumhor, t etc defined as properties somewhere else in the document\n<Diogo__> yes, look property var sumquant        property var sumhor        property var sumM        property var sumV        property var sumA         property var sumw        property var t        property var x1        property var y1        property var k        property var r\n<Diogo__> as global properties, but if you need, i send you the hole code\n<DanChapman> great, can i ask what are you trying to achieve here? I feel overwhelmed with all those parseInt's :-D yes the whole document would be easier to try and understand it\n<Diogo__> i want to make an app that calculates how much a person will pay in his enrgy bills by asking him to insert the quantaty, (ampers and voltes in case they dont know the watts of from exemple the computer), the hours and minuts\n<Diogo__> that will calculate the price\n<Diogo__> here is the full code\n<Diogo__> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7775481/\n<popey> happy birthday Elleo!\n<DanChapman> Wow! that's ALOT of TextFields\n<Diogo__> yea i know\n<Diogo__> 48 to be precise\n<DanChapman> :-D right so i believe NaN usually means \"Not a Number\" so my first thoughts are you aren't doing any checks to be sure all of your \"48\" textfields contain a number. You should probably default them to 0 if they are empty.\n<Diogo__> in the text i need to set 0\n<Diogo__> so that they get 0, if i dont use them right??\n<DanChapman> yes\n<fginther> popey, balloons, I'm going through the packages that have changed since the last successful music-app-ci run. There's a lot. One noticable change is a change in the qt modules from 5.3.0-3ubuntu6 to 5.3.0-3ubuntu7 but I can't say if that is related\n<balloons> fginther, I mention the UITK, because it landed, and is my first target for what might be the issue\n<fginther> balloons, taking a closer look at http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/generic-mediumtests-utopic/924 and 928 (both calendar-app). There are fewer changes there, one of them is still libqt5qml5 and friends moving to 5.3.0-3ubuntu7\n<fginther> balloons, the ui-toolkit specific packages did not change between the 2\n<balloons> fginther, no it's different: http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/generic-mediumtests-utopic/928/artifact/dpkg-l.pre.log, http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/generic-mediumtests-utopic/924/artifact/dpkg-l.pre.log\n<balloons> finally found the dpkg log :-)\n<Diogo__> Dan i think it's working now :)\n<Diogo__> going to do a few tests and then i tell you :)\n<fginther> balloons, which package are you referring to?\n<balloons> ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot\n<fginther> balloons, oh indeed, I was looking at the wrong package\n<balloons> fginther, so I'm going to run with the old version locally, then update again and see if it break\n<fginther> balloons, shouldn't qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-ui-toolkit-plugin be the same version?\n<balloons> t1mp_, ^^?\n<fginther> qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-ui-toolkit-plugin == 0.1.47+14.10.20140619-0ubuntu1\n<fginther> ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot == 0.1.49+14.10.20140707-0ubuntu1\n<balloons> fginther, yea I see it's older. They changed things around on packaging, I'd have to go look at the project\n<balloons> let's see\n<balloons> fginther, afaict yes, they should be the same\n<balloons> and I see there is a corresponding version for the plugin that matches\n<balloons> it's packaged in the same place, and builds etc.. should be the same ;-)\n<balloons> do we list the source I wonder.. why is it still seeing the old version.. perhaps a ppa\n<fginther> I can dig\n<balloons> fginther, kk.. if nothing else we should solve the discrepancy :-)\n<fginther> balloons, it's being fixed.\n<balloons> fginther, awesome thanks. I guess we'll try the re-runs once fixed and hopefully see sucess\n<fginther> balloons, I've cleaned up the package mess and am running a test build now\n<balloons> what was the issue?\n<fginther> apt-get upgrade was bailing out because some packages had to be removed to complete the upgrade\n<fginther> thinking about switching to a dist-upgrade\n<balloons> fginther, ahh, yea, things can get fun running -devel\n<fginther> balloons, tests appear to be passing now. i think that helped\n<balloons> fginther, awesome\n<balloons> fginther, so I can kick off rebuilds?\n<nik90_> jdstrand: ping (security policy issue)\n<fginther> balloons, hang on, looks like another issue waiting to happen there (out of disk space)\n<balloons> k, just let me know\n<balloons> popey, the jenkins issues should be cleared/clearing up\n<popey> thanks balloons\n<fginther> balloons, \\o/\n<fginther> balloons, my test passed, can you try a few rebuilds?\n<balloons> fginther, yes, kicked off builds for the 2 failing merges\n<t1mp_> fginther, balloons yes, qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-ui-toolkit-plugin and ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot must be the same version\n<ahayzen> kenvandine, thanks for the email regarding content-hub, so the last issue is then reloading the models so that this imported track actually appears in the other views\n<mihir> nik90_: ping\n<nik90_> mihir: pong\n<mihir> nik90_: how can we hide OSK ?\n<nik90_> mihir: Qt.inputMethod.hide().\n<mihir> Qt.InputMethod?\n<nik90_> mihir: http://nik90.com/ubuntu-touch-keyboard-tricks/\n<mihir> nik90_:  thanks :)\n<nik90_> mihir: np\n * nik90_ steps away to prepare dinner\n<kenvandine> ahayzen, yeah, but at least the file gets to the right place :)\n<kenvandine> ahayzen, is anyone working on giving you an API to reload the model?\n<ahayzen> kenvandine, yeah :) i'll have a go at implementing that over the next few days.... no not yet\n<ahayzen> kenvandine, we haven't talked to the mediascanner guys yet to get their view on the situation .... popey ^^ was going to send a mail (or was i?) ?\n<popey> i was, but then i saw kenvandine's mail\n<popey> but i still need to\n<kenvandine> so that'll be the last piece of the puzzle\n<ahayzen> yep :)\n<kenvandine> ahayzen, i'm going to make that change to the move api now\n<ahayzen> kenvandine, thanks :)\n<kenvandine> np\n<t1mp_> ahayzen: hi\n<ahayzen> t1mp_, o/\n<t1mp_> ahayzen: sorry about delaying the panelHeight MR.\n<t1mp_> ahayzen: I got caught up in fixing some regression\n<balloons> ahayzen, random question for you.. does mediascanner2 eat all your cpu?\n<ahayzen> t1mp_, no worries was just wondering if there was anything else i needed to do... it resolves the issue for me\n<t1mp_> ahayzen: I need to update one test in that MR and then make sure no apps break, and then we can land it\n<ahayzen> balloons, depends\n<ahayzen> t1mp_, awesome :)\n<t1mp_> ahayzen: I try to get it done tomorrow, so then it would land beginning of next week\n<ahayzen> t1mp_, sweet!\n<ahayzen> balloons, on the initial scan... yes it does... but afterwards no it doesn't\n<ahayzen> balloons, but i do have some suspicions about how it is indexing\n<ahayzen> balloons, what is the issue your seeing?\n<balloons> it just locks my pc\n<ahayzen> balloons, ah\n<ahayzen> balloons, tbh i think it is commiting after it adds each file to db ... if this is true then bundling the data and commiting say 5,10 records of metadata to the db at one time could imrpove the performance\n<balloons> ahayzen, probably worth filing a bug on\n<balloons> I had to uninstall it just now, as it locked my pc again\n<ahayzen> balloons, yeah its on my list of things to investigate/poke people about :)\n<ahayzen> balloons, how is ur investigation into the jenkins failures going?\n<balloons> ahayzen, they are fixed\n<ahayzen> balloons, i did start making a py3 branch of the music-app tests...got all the cmake converted just need to convert the tests....\n<ahayzen> balloons, \\o/ what was the issue?\n<balloons> the current failure you see is legitimate..\n<balloons> in that the tests are running properly at least\n<balloons> ahayzen, outdated version of the toolkit matched with a new version of the toolkit helpers\n<ahayzen> balloons, ok thanks\n<popey> jdstrand: 19:39:09 < m-b-o> mhall119: Jul 10 20:38:41 ubuntu-phablet kernel: [25787.785316] type=1400 audit(1405017521.045:112):

small GUI application for ubuntu in fluxbox window environment. Does any one have experience with fluxbox environment???\n<amanthakur> ????\n<jmunsch> amanthakur : maybe also ask in #fluxbox?\n<amanthakur> didn't knew that they do have a channel\n<amanthakur> thanks\n<jmunsch> amanthakur : http://fluxbox.org/help/\n<jmunsch> np\n<balloons> nik90_, you about?\n<nik90_> balloons: yeah\n<balloons> nik90_, so how is the new clock app coming? I hear you might need some tests\n<nik90_> balloons: we got some of the core functionality up and running like the alarms\n<nik90_> balloons: we are thinking ahead to what is required to replace the old clock app. The first thing would be autopilot followed by translation framework.\n<Letozaf_> balloons, :)\n<balloons> nik90_, meet Letozaf_.. I'm not sure you two have met?\n<nik90_> balloons: I don't think so...\n<nik90_> hi Letozaf_\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, hello, nice to meet you!\n<balloons> Anyways, nik90_, Letozaf_ is always interested in writing some AP tests ;-) I'm thinking she might enjoy helping out\n<nik90_> me too :)\n<Letozaf_> Letozaf_, :)\n<balloons> and that might help make sure everything is done in time\n<nik90_> oh awesome!\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, balloons how can I help ^\n<Letozaf_> ?\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: so we have rewritten the clock app from scratch and it has no autopilot tests at the moment. It would be really helpful if you could get the tests up and running for the features we have implemented until now\n<nik90_> balloons: Can you check if the current cmake implementation has what it needs to run autopilot tests using click-buddy?\n<nik90_> balloons: this should Letozaf_ run the ap tests to see if they run as expected\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, balloons ok\n<balloons> Letozaf_, sound doable? Essentially nik90_ is rewriting the current clock app, so in the end the features will match, but at the moment they don't :-)\n<balloons> it's a new design..\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: I can email you the appropriate links to the project page and provide some instructions on how to run the new clock app.\n<balloons> nik90_, that would be great\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: btw, which Ubuntu release are you running and do you have a phone running Ubuntu Touch?\n<Letozaf_> balloons, yes fine it would be great\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: if you don't have a phone, an emulator should be just as fine.\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, I have Utopic running now, but it's not a problem to put whatever version is needed on my laptop and yes I have a Nexus 4\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: awesome..Utopic is the one we are targeting so that's good.\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, balloons just tell me where to start and I will, hope to be useful\n<nik90_> popey: can you invite Letozaf_ to the trello board? It would be easier to help track autopilots tasks there.\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: We keep track of clock app (and other apps) tasks at https://trello.com/b/Ie2rAS3W/core-apps-management\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: you might want to bookmark that. You can filter the cards to see just the clock app related ones.\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, ok let me take a look\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: at the moment there aren't any tasks related to autopilot but I will create tasks there to help you get started\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, fine thanks\n<t1mp> nik90_: your MR failed due to an unrelated bug which is fixed, but we have to wait till tomorrow when the fix is in the image\n<t1mp> nik90_: so let's try to get your MR in again tomorrow\n<nik90_> t1mp: ok, np\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: btw, my nick will be always online on IRC. So feel free to leave me messages and I will get to them when I am at the computer.\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, ok thanks\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, do I get the new clock app at lp:ubuntu-clock-app or have you put it somewhere else ?\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: the new clock app is housed at lp:ubuntu-clock-app/reboot\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-clock-dev/ubuntu-clock-app/utopic-3.0\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: can you pm me your email address and I will send a mail tomorrow morning with the necessary info.\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, great!\n<balloons> nik90_, awesome..let me see if I can add Letozaf_ to the board\n<balloons> Letozaf_, I added you\n<nik90_> balloons: thnx\n<Letozaf_> balloons, thanks\n<balloons> so nik90_, Letozaf_ I'll check on the cmake build stuff, and otherwise I assume you two can work out what tests are needed, etc. As always, feel free to ping with questions.\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: I created a card to keep track of the AP tests and I have assigned it to you.\n<nik90_> balloons: yeah I will work with Letozaf_ to get the tests up and running and provide help where ever needed.\n<balloons> awesome.. should be fun! thanks again Carla\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, ok\n<nik90_> :)\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, fine so I will wait for your e-mail :)\n<Letozaf_> balloons, nik90_ yeah sure it will be fun :) can't wait!\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: Ok. I am generally quick on these things :)\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, :P I will be back tomorrow night (in Italy) that is 18-19 UTC I think\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: ok. I am in the Netherlands, so the time works with me.\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, great!\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, argh! sorry you lost against Argentina :(\n<balloons> I can't believe that went to penalty kicks\n<Letozaf_> balloons, I bet Nederlands would have won\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: hehe..most of the game was spent in the mid fields :/ .. I rather have a game like Germany vs OtherCountries\n<nik90_> balloons: netherlands has a terrible record with winning in the penalties..\n<Letozaf_> nik90_, suppose Germany will win the cup :)\n<nik90_> Letozaf_: I wouldn't be surprised...:0\n<nik90_> :)\n<Elleo> popey: thanks :)\n<popey> \u00e2\u0098\u00bb\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2014-07-11\n<justCarakas> is there a way to send or read text messages in an app ?\n<mzanetti> nik90_: hey, tried to use the alarm clock today. doesn't seem to ring off for me. what's the state there?\n<mzanetti> is it supposed to work or still WIP?\n<JamesTait> Good morning all; happy Friday and happy World Population Day! :-D\n<nik90_> mzanetti: Good morning\n<mzanetti> nik90_: Good morning\n<nik90_> mzanetti: The alarm should work as expected. I woke up to them for the past 4-5 days\n<mzanetti> nik90_: hmm... can I verify on the command line somehow if the alarm is actually set? or any other means to debu git?\n<mzanetti> really doesn't ring ever here\n<nik90_> mzanetti: the alarm is stored at .local/share/evolution/tasks/randomfoldername/tasks.ics\n<nik90_> mzanetti: if you can get me that folder, I can check if EDS has saved it properly or no\n<nik90_> not*\n<mzanetti> nik90_: ack. can't fetch it right now as I'm working on another device. but will get you that folder in a few\n<nik90_> mzanetti: np, I will be here\n<mzanetti> cool\n<popey> https://github.com/loqui/im interesting\n<popey> its in the FFOS store.\n<popey> has WhatsApp support (unofficial)\n<davmor2> popey: how do you change the title of a note book in reminders or for that matter delete one the only options I see when I click on a note book are search and refresh\n<popey> davmor2: do it on the web\n<dpm> davmor2, click on the edit button on the header, it should let you edit the title and the content of the note\n<davmor2> popey: also if you edit a note in a notebook why does it move it auto change the notebook I'm in to first notebook.  IE Notebook 1,2,3 I have a note in 3 I hit edit change the note text hit save and it default to save it in 1\n<dpm> davmor2, and the notebook thing is probably a bug\n<popey> bugs.launchpad.net/reminders-app\n<davmor2> dpm: I have   =Notebooks + =  if I click on the notebook in question I get < Personal nores + =   hence wanting to change the title :)\n<dpm> davmor2, ah, sorry, I misread the notebook title change\n<dpm> I read \"note\"\n<davmor2> So that is a feature request and a bug then thanks\n<davmor2> dpm: you sure you want me to test this?\n<dpm> davmor2, indeed, it makes sense as a feature, I think\n<dpm> davmor2, I'm never sure to have you test things, as you always manage to break them! :)\n<davmor2> dpm: also if you setup an account, and then open the app after the account is added it say you have no account add one click here, you click there it takes you to a page where you click accept and then goes back to the app, that doesn't seem right some how\n<dpm> davmor2, the workflow is right, but the message needs to change. The reason being, if you create the account outside the app, then you need to authorize the app to use the account the first time. If you create the account from within the app, it then does the authorisation transparently for you\n<dpm> but I noticed that one with the message too. We need to be able to detect whether there is genuinely no account, or whether there is an account that needs authorisation\n<davmor2> dpm: oh indeed, it's not a wrong workflow but it saying there is No account when you know for a fact you just created one is the but thats meh\n<dpm> indeed\n<mzanetti> nik90_: here you go: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7779376\n<mzanetti> nik90_: interesting thing that there are 4 alarms in there, should be 2 only\n<nik90_> mzanetti: are you running the latest image?\n<mzanetti> nik90_: promoted one\n<mzanetti> not devel-proposed\n<nik90_> mzanetti: ok\n<mzanetti> nik90_: but even if those 4 alarms would be what I want. I never heard any of those actually ring\n<nik90_> mzanetti: does the saved alarm appear in the date time indicator?\n<mzanetti> nik90_: no... nothing in there\n<mzanetti> which probably explains why they're not ringing\n<nik90_> yeah\n<nik90_> can you create an alarm to ring in the next 5 minutes and see if it appears in the indicator?\n<mzanetti> ack\n<mzanetti> uuh. clock app crashed switching to the alarm tab\n<nik90_> were you trying to create a new alarm?\n<nik90_> or editing an existing one?\n<mzanetti> i was on the stop watch tab, wanted to switch to the alarms tab -> boom\n<mzanetti> now it works\n<mzanetti> nik90_: ack. set an alarm to go off in 5 mins, it appeard in the indicators\n<mzanetti> hmm... I have a suspicion... let me wait until this one went off and I'll play around a bit more\n<nik90_> mzanetti: there is one case where the alarm might not ring, When you create a single type alarm and it rings.

However on this https://code.launchpad.net/~andrew-hayzen/music-app/abstract-row-second-iteration/+merge/226549 i've just\n<ahayzen>  got the same issue, I only changed 1 line of code between the revisions (added a margin to something) and this test worked one time and not the other. Any ideas what is going on?\n<balloons> ahayzen, yes it'd be worth looking deeper at the tests to see why the random fails\n<balloons> off the top, nothing simple\n<ahayzen> balloons, hmm maybe in our refactor hehe\n<ahayzen> balloons, ok so just rerun for now?\n<balloons> yes :-)\n<ahayzen> balloons, can u retrigger for me so i don't have to empty commit?\n<balloons> yepper\n<ahayzen> thanks\n<ahayzen> balloons, success \\o/ lol\n<balloons> :-)\n<balloons> lol\n<elopio> gerlowskija: balloons: you are fixing the bug that causes duplicate events \\o/\n<elopio> what's weird on this run is that the machine has many events:\n<elopio> http://91.189.93.70:8080/job/generic-mediumtests-utopic/984/artifact/calendar_app.tests.test_new_event.NewEventTestCase.test_add_new_event_with_default_values%20%28with%20mouse%29.ogv\n<balloons> elopio, well we tried.. seems something is still a bit off\n<elopio> isn't jenkins starting a new machine for every run?\n<balloons> elopio, that's not weird, in so much as events don't delete well\n<balloons> calendar isolation isn't working atm, I believe\n<elopio> start_time, end_time = time_label.text.split(' - ')\n<elopio> ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack\n<elopio> anyway, this error means that there is an event whose time label doesn't match {start time} -  {end time}\n<elopio> it might be a previosly existing all day event?\n<elopio> I didn't write the helper to work on that case.\n<elopio> hum, my calendar from trunk doesn't work nicely now.\n<elopio> balloons: gerlowskija: actually, if you look at the video, it shows a new event with no time, and the bubble is on today and tomorrow.\n<elopio> there could be a problem creating an event for the last half hour of the day.\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2014-07-12\n<elopio> ok, this won't work for 24 hours on jenkins :(\n<elopio> tomorrow, I think it will pass.\n<daker> balloons: https://twitter.com/UbuntuTesting/status/487760664325156864\n<balloons> daker, thanks.. weird\n<balloons> elopio, I'll take your word for it\n<gerlowskija> elopio: ping\n<nik90_> mzanetti: ping\n<mzanetti> nik90_: hey\n<nik90_> mzanetti: hey would it be possible to have a hangout for about 20-30 minutes to pick your brain on a qml c++ plugin?\n<nik90_> mzanetti: doesn't have to be today\n<nik90_> mzanetti: anytime you are free would be nice\n<mzanetti> nik90_: sure\n<nik90_> mzanetti: when would you like to have it?\n<mzanetti> hmm, maybe a bit later today...\n<mzanetti> nik90_: a bit busy atm, can I ping you later about it?\n<nik90_> mzanetti: alrite, ping me when you are free later\n<mzanetti> ok\n<nik90_> yeah\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  thank you for helping out the folks with the menu probelm :) I was out of network reach.\n<nik90_> bzoltan: no worries :)\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  so it seems that the new 3.1.1 release did not mess up anything :)\n<nik90_> bzoltan: yup :)\n<bzoltan> nik90_: it is a huge luck that we got the qtc 3.1.1 backported to qt52 ... when it was released with the 5.3 I wonder how long our luck will last. At some point QtC will not be backportable to the LTS\n<nik90_> bzoltan: I can imagine..I have been coding in a 14.10 VM for the past few weeks. I suppose we must update the instructions on developer.ubuntu.com to use a 14.10 VM or release instead of 14.04\n<nik90_> bzoltan: Or even better, provide a downloadable VM that people can use just for development purposes with all the necessary tools ready\n<nik90_> bzoltan: In the future when Unity 8 becomes default, would it be possible to provide QtC+Qt 5.x in a click package that people can install without having to upgrade their OS? That would make it super convenient to stick with one OS version and keep updating the SDK.\n<bzoltan> nik90_: Yes, in the confined click world this issue will be different.\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  SDK in VM is a trivial solution but to be honest I find it rather unprofessional as a primary method of distribution.\n<nik90_> bzoltan: I agree, but requesting developers to download a development release of Ubuntu which cannot be found so easily is helpful either.\n<nik90_> isn't helpful either*\n<bzoltan> nik90_: I think either the co-installation of minor Qt releases should be resolved, or we need to install the Qt to the user space.\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  LTS is LTS, so we will never suggest developers to upgrade from LTS to use the SDK\n<nik90_> bzoltan: at the moment, for an external 3rd party app dev, it is confusing to install 14.04 and then realise that he won't get the new headers and other cool sdk features\n<bzoltan> nik90_: why would not he get? It is all in the emulator and in the chroot... When a developer installs the Android SDK on OSX is it expected to see all the android APIs on the OSX?\n<bzoltan> nik90_: I know it will take time to educate some folks that the development environment and the target environment are two different place\n<nik90_> bzoltan: true that would work\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  the problem right now is that we should support not only the phone app development but the desktop app/scope development. Right now we have good target emulator of the phone, but not for the desktop. But it is being worked out :)\n<nik90_> bzoltan: yeah I am waiting for rsalvetti to add support for updating the emulator images on the fly. Currently we have to recreate the emulator to get the latest image\n<nik90_> bzoltan: although I guess this shouldn't be too much of an issue for people targetting the stable images in the future\n<bzoltan> nik90_:  yes, it should not be much. The emulator update would be fun.\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2014-07-13\n<gerlowskija> I'm using the UbuntuSDK to look around at API pages.  It's nice to have the docs integrated right into the IDE.

I looked online at the docs and 1 other tutorial, but couldn't fix it\n<mzanetti> looks like a bug to me tbh\n<mzanetti> do you have the link to the tutorial you're talking about?\n<nik90_> mzanetti: I looked at http://www.ics.com/blog/whats-new-qt-52-qtimezone\n<nik90_> mzanetti: there he displays the local time at a specific timezone ID, however when I run that example, the times returned are incorrect.\n<mzanetti> yeah... he's using QWidget, it stays inside C++ then\n<mzanetti> nik90_: I believe it looses timezone information when coverting to a JavaScript Date object for qml\n<nik90_> mzanetti: But I ran his own example. He provides the source code at the bottom of the tutorial.\n<nik90_> mzanetti: When I run his example and choose say \"Asia/Kolkata\", I notice that it return 01:38 which is wrong since the time should be 20:07 there.\n<mzanetti> hmm...\n<mzanetti> something is definitely fishy with that timezone stuff\n<nik90_> yeah\n<nik90_> mzanetti: are you able to see the correct time if you choose to output it within c++ itself?\n<mzanetti> yes\n<nik90_> mzanetti: if that is the case, then I could make the c++ plugin return a string with the time instead of a javascript date object\n<mzanetti> heh, yeah, doing that already\n<mzanetti> this is the output:\n<mzanetti> QDateTime(\"2014-07-13 17:31:53.405 EEST Qt::TimeZone Asia/Amman\")\n<mzanetti> qml: Sun Jul 13 16:31:53 2014 GMT+0200\n<mzanetti> the first line is from c++, the second from qml\n<mzanetti> on the same object\n<mzanetti> well, sort of...\n<nik90_> but the 17:31 time returned in c++ is incorrect though\n<nik90_> the current time at Amman is 20:12\n<mzanetti> ah ok...\n<mzanetti> lemme fix that\n<daker> nik90_: no it's correct\n<nik90_> daker: I checked at http://www.prokerala.com/travel/timezones/Asia/Amman\n<nik90_> daker: actually nvr mind you are correct. just looked at http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/zoneinfo.tzc?s=default&tz=Asia/Amman now\n<nik90_> mzanetti: ^^\n<nik90_> mzanetti: the time is correct, sry\n<mzanetti> ah ok :D\n<mzanetti> nik90_: you managed to confuse me\n<mzanetti> :)\n<nik90_> :D\n<nik90_> mzanetti: can you check \"America/Chicago\"\n<mzanetti> nik90_: Sun Jul 13 09:51:35 2014 GMT\n<nik90_> mzanetti: it should be 09:51\n<nik90_> sweet!\n<mzanetti> ack\n<mzanetti> nik90_: ok, so I pushed to lp:~mzanetti/+junk/fix-explain-zone-class\n<nik90_> mzanetti: thnx\n<mzanetti> nik90_: I've added lots of comments, hope you find them useful\n<nik90_> mzanetti: wow thnx for the comments.

You've already done good by implementing a QAbstractVideoSurface\n<greyback> you don't want to get a QImage (which is not on the GPU). Instead it is better to put the webcam frame into a texture on the GPU, which then QtMultimedia & QML can render\n<ohmy> greyback: sure, the thing is that i need  a way to view theses images in two (or more different) windows, reason why i'm not using the camera element of QML\n<ohmy> greyback: and i'm nnot OpenGL expert, i really just need to grab these frames and show them in two separate qml containers\n<ohmy> greyback: do you know any example that can helps me ?\n<greyback> ohmy: you need to view the live webcam output in 2 separate places simultaneously? Or a live view in one, and a static frame in another\n<ohmy> greyback: two live in 2 separate QML containers at the same time (same PC)\n<greyback> ohmy: hmm, I suggest you investigate 2 channels. One is to try writing a qml test file using QtMultimedia to play a video\n<greyback> https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/QtMultimedia.VideoOutput/\n<greyback> and then modify it to see if you can have two VideoOutputs using the same MediaPlayer as their source\n<greyback> if that works, I suggest you continue your work and integrate your webcam as a backend for qtmultimedia\n<ohmy> greyback: im trying, AFAIK you can only have one VideoOutput :( but i'm trying, thanks a lot\n<greyback> ohmy: if you are indeed correct, you'll have a tougher time of it.

So if the milestones apply to all apps, then we can file them under the ubuntu-phone-coreapps-common project (and BPs as well). If the milestones are _not_ global, then we can file them and the BPs under the one app\n<popey> dpm: right, i made them under the app because you need them there for bug tagging\n<popey> but the bp is under commons\n<popey> (I have always found this incredibly frustrating, and was only done this way for the burndown charts iirc)\n<popey> dpm: shall i move the bp to the app?\n<dpm> popey, yeah, that's what I was going to suggest\n<popey> given a) its app specific and we dont use burndown\n<popey> ok\n<dpm> indeed\n<popey> also b)\n<popey> ok\n<dpm> yeah, app-specific milestones and app-specific BP that matches those milestones\n<ahoneybun> is ListItem.Standard dead?\n<ahoneybun> in Ubuntu.Compontents 1.2?\n<ahoneybun> I now just using ListItem but it has some weird spacing when using Label\n<ahoneybun> http://imgur.com/NXensVQ\n<TLyngeJ> Right, so the bottom section, of page that was linked too, regarding adding access to a new service at Google, apparently descripes how to add a new provider, like Google, not add a new service to an existing provider.\n<TLyngeJ> I tried to have a look at http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-calendar-dev/ubuntu-calendar-app/trunk/files/691 to see how that register the calander service, but I got none the wiser.\n<popey> TLyngeJ: huh?\n<TLyngeJ> popey: You know how the core app add access to the Google calendar API, in the OnlineAccounts? I'd like to acheive the same, just for Google Books.\n<popey> Oh, nice idea.\n<popey> youtube app does the same\n<TLyngeJ> From my app I can access the already existing provider services (like gmail and calendar), but I can see the service that I've defined in my own .service file.\n<TLyngeJ> I also took a neak peek into /usr/share/accounts/services/google-calendar.service, but still no dice.\n * TLyngeJ takes a look-see at the youtube app.\n<ahoneybun> so removing useDeprecatedToolbar got me this: qml: Page.tools is a deprecated property.

I noticed that too. It basically seems there currently is no good \"non-deprecated\" replacement for those Ubuntu.Components.ListItems other than a bareboes ListView from Ubuntu.Components (that supports swipe actions, etc). You need to flesh it out yourself. I was actually thinking of fixing the situation and work out a set of reusable listview components I would submit to ubuntu component store, but I'm currently a tad ...\n<karni> ... busy. I may get to it though some time.\n<ahoneybun> karni: currently I'm just using: import Ubuntu.Components.ListItems 1.0 as ListItem for the time being\n<ahoneybun> still\n<karni> TBH I'm a bit surprized with the decision to go ahead with barebones ListView and deprecate all those old ones\n<karni> ahoneybun: yeah, that'll work for some time at least\n<ahoneybun> I really should use UbuntuShape for my Family tab...\n<ahoneybun> I want to use the toolbar items\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: there should be no problem using Ubuntu.Components.ListItems\n<ahoneybun> thanks t1mp\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: although in 1.2 we have the new ListItem component that will replace the Ubuntu.Components.ListItems\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: for the new ListItem we do not have default layouts yet, so everything that is inside the list item (title, icon, ..) you have to add yourself\n<DF___> Hey there\n<ahoneybun> t1mp: so ListItem.Standard/Header and such are gone?\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: see https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/apps/qml/sdk-15.04/Ubuntu.Components.ListItem/ and https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2015/04/15/retrospective-and-roadmap-ui-toolkit/\n<DF___> some one know anything about creating a webservice ??\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: they still exist, but they will be removed for UITK 2.0 (which we did not yet start to work on)\n<ahoneybun> so I have time\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: yes\n<ahoneybun> all these changes\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: ListItem.Standard etc. are still even in UITK 1.3 (which we are working on but is not released yet)\n<ahoneybun> ok\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: but the new ListItem has cool new features such as left/right swipe to show actions, and its performance is very good\n<ahoneybun> thats cool and all but I never have used it for that so not much use to me but a headache\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: here is a short list of improvements for the ListItem https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2015/03/30/ubuntu-components-1-2-release/\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: okay\n<ahoneybun> thanks for the info very much t1mp\n<ahoneybun> how would I use toolbaritems with tabs?\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: what do you mean with toolbaritems?\n<ahoneybun> code: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~aaronhoneycutt/ubuntu-beginner/2.0/files\n<t1mp> if by toolbar, you mean the bar you can swipe in from the bottom, that is deprecated\n<ahoneybun> I want a Info button on the header bar\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: set Page.head.actions: [ yourAction ]\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: see https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/apps/qml/sdk-15.04/Ubuntu.Components.PageHeadConfiguration/\n<ahoneybun> so this is uselss for this?:https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/apps/qml/sdk-15.04/Ubuntu.Components.ToolbarButton/\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: yes, it is useless.\n<t1mp> we should have that marked as deprecated, something is wrong with the docs\n<popey> DF___: i think you need to explain what you mean by web service\n<ahoneybun> very hard to keep up to date\n<t1mp> oh we didn't mark it as deprecated\n<ahoneybun> t1mp: so when I click the item I want it to load a qml file\n<ahoneybun> the about.qml file\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: probably you should put a PageStack in your app, and you can do something like Page.head.actions: [ Action { iconName: \"help\"; onTriggered: pageStack.push(Qt.resolvedUrl(\"about.qml\")) } ]\n<t1mp> ah there is a standard icon for info also, so you can use iconName: \"info\"\n<ahoneybun> t1mp: but I think tabs work best for this no?\n<mcphail> nemo: going to be a while before I can run the rebuild\n<ahoneybun> I was just looking for its name\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: using a PageStack seems good to me.\n<koda> o/\n<ahoneybun> t1mp: seems hard for me\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: Tabs always appear in the dropdown menu on the left of the title. I think an action in the header that pushes the new page on a PageStack is better.\n<ahoneybun> oh?\n<ahoneybun> hey koda\n<t1mp> ahoneybun: there are some PageStack examples here https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/apps/qml/sdk-15.04/Ubuntu.Components.PageStack/\n<ahoneybun> got it open t1mp :)\n<t1mp> you could use Tabs too, that is up to you.

I could build a PPA\n<nemo> mcphail: I was initially hoping you could just make minor changes to whatever ubuntu process was in use.\n<nemo> although, might be more convoluted for making repeated changes\n<mcphail> nemo: I can make the minor changes and let the PPA build-bot produce a deb.

I know popey worked on it. I have a patch that adds thumbnails for jpegs, png's, and gifs, but autopilot is failing 10 tests\n<akiva-thinkpad> however, autopilot is failing 10 tests even without my changes\n<ohmy> good morning all\n<ohmy> Is there anyway from QML/C++ (without compositor) to define on wich display (monitor) we can display a Window ?\n<ohmy> lets say i have monitor1 and monitor2 and i want programatically to show a Windows on one of them\n<mcphail> zubozrout: hi\n<zubozrout> Ok, I am here mcphail\n<zubozrout> mcphail: Hi :0\n<zubozrout> * :)\n<mcphail> :) - how much experience do you have making .click packages?\n<zubozrout> mcphail: practically zero, I only made some stuff using the SDK\n<mcphail> zubozrout: we don't have a working sdl template for the SDK yet, but that doesn't matter. Building and creating a .click is easy. SturmFlut is working on the template\n<SturmFlut> mcphail: Well, \"working\" is a bit much to say ;)\n<zubozrout> Well, it would be nice to have it documented at least.\n<mcphail> SturmFlut: :)\n<mcphail> zubozrout: the first thing is to set up a build environment. Give me a sec and I'll find a link\n<mcphail> zubozrout: this is essential reading: https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2015/04/13/inner-workings-sdk/\n<mcphail> zubozrout: getting a chroot set up takes time, but it is very automated and foolproof\n<zubozrout> mcphail: ok, thanks :)\n<mcphail> zubozrout: the next thing you have to do is get a version of SDL which works with Mir. See: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcphail/ubuntu-touch-sdl-template/master/lib/src/how_to_build_sdl_for_ubuntu_phone.txt\n<mcphail> zubozrout: you can take the SDL libs from that github repo. They \"wrok\"\n<mcphail> *work\n<zubozrout> mcphail: All right, that is fine to know. So it is not just as simple as apt-get install somesdlstuff and then running it.\n<mcphail> zubozrout: not quite, but when you have the framework set up is is simple\n<mcphail> zubozrout: the difficulty is getting the first steps done\n<mcphail> zubozrout: you can then compile or download the ARM binary for your SDL app and roll it in a .click package\n<zubozrout> mcphail: well, the app has to be compiled with the above SDL libs, yes.\n<mcphail> zubozrout: you can compile _against_ any SDL2 libs, but you have to roll that specific version into your .click\n<mcphail> zubozrout: that means you can take any precompiled binary from the Ubuntu repos, but roll it with my SDL2\n<zubozrout> mcphail: Ah :), ok, thanks :)\n<mcphail> zubozrout: of course, the biggest problem is that SDL2 still doesn't quite work...\n<mcphail> zubozrout: there are issues with coulours, transparency and rotation which are still getting smoothed out\n<mcphail> bschaefer is on the case\n<dubstar_04> popey what happened to the ubuntu update podcast?\n<zubozrout> mcphail: Yes, I know of some issues. And what will happen once click is replaced with snappy packages on Ubuntu?\n<mcphail> zubozrout: not much difference\n<mcphail> zubozrout: for these purposes, click and snappy are almost identical\n<mcphail> (i think)\n<zubozrout> mcphail: ok :)\n<mcphail> zubozrout: the hassle with building a .click is you have to bundle all the needed libraries into the click itself. Snappy will be the same\n<zubozrout> mcphail: Well, thank you very much for the info. I'll read it and try it - and then ask here again if I bump into any problem\n<mcphail> zubozrout: enjoy! - it is easier than it looks\n<zubozrout> mcphail: Thanks :), you were very helpful.\n<mivoligo> mzanetti: ping :)\n<SturmFlut> An Ubuntu phone will launch in India!\n<mivoligo> mzanetti: (or anyone who knows) what I understand in OTA-5 there will be full shell rotation and if I want to force for example portrait orientation for my app, I need to specify that in .desktop file. (thanks popey) Will there be an option to specify app orientation when the app is already running?\n<akiva-thinkpad> SturmFlut: The meizu?\n<akiva-thinkpad> http://i.imgur.com/TZPiI8B.png << :)\n<SturmFlut> akiva-thinkpad: Most likely, don't think it would make much sense to assume it's bq. We already know that Meizu wants to launch the MX4 with Flyme in India.\n<akiva-thinkpad> SturmFlut: lucky :/\n<akiva-thinkpad> I still don't have one.\n<akiva-thinkpad> nothing in North America~\n<akiva-thinkpad> Hopefully by the end of the year!\n<SturmFlut> akiva-thinkpad: Don't really think so, there hasn't been any committment from a manufacturer for the US market yet. And porting to a new device takes time.\n<akiva-thinkpad> SturmFlut: Well it will come here eventually. No reason to delay it~\n<zubozrout> SturmFlut: And what about MX5 with Ubuntu? I suppose no one wants to spread the word now, but I would soo much love to see it with Ubuntu. I wanted to purchase MX4 but MX5 is better :), more bleeding-edge.\n<akiva-thinkpad> is it that much better :o\n<akiva-thinkpad> ?\n<zubozrout> akiva-thinkpad: Not to mention 64bit processor - I wanted to have a phone with that for a long time and if MX5 was available with Ubuntu I wouldn't have to wait another round :).\n<zubozrout> akiva-thinkpad: so I think it is great, in my eyes\n<akiva-thinkpad> :O But does it work in Canada?!\n<zubozrout> akiva-thinkpad: Why wouldn't it?\n<akiva-thinkpad> zubozrout: north american has different bands than the rest of the world\n<akiva-thinkpad> mx4 does not have our band.\n<akiva-thinkpad> best we can get is 2g\n<zubozrout> akiva-thinkpad: Well, I know there is a problem with LTE and MX4 + MX5 in the Czech Republic (where I live), so with the supported frequencies I can only have LTE in the capital (Prague) but almost nowhere else although I have LTE with my Nexus 7 deb tablet all over the country.\n<akiva-thinkpad> lucky europeans :P\n<zubozrout> akiva-thinkpad: Well, maybe lucky europeans except for the Czech Republic. I think Canada has better (nicer) mobile carriers than are here.\n<akiva-thinkpad> We have wind, thats it\n<akiva-thinkpad> Rogers... oh my blood pressure...\n<akiva-thinkpad> \"What do you mean I owe you $500 ? You cancelled my phone 5 months ago; I couldnt even use it!\" Reply:\n<zubozrout> akiva-thinkpad: hmm, and no Vodafone or T-mobile? I know they are in the USA.\n<akiva-thinkpad> \"oh no, we just cancelled your service, you still need to pay for your plan\"\n<akiva-thinkpad> No, and the best network in the US is Ting\n<akiva-thinkpad> which ironically is from Canada, but can't operate in Canada\n<zubozrout> akiva-thinkpad: lol, well, that's sad. Yep, I heard about Ting, it has pretty nice reviews.\n<mzanetti> mivoligo, not in the beginning, but there are plans for such an api\n<mivoligo> mzanetti: thanks, is that the rest I said correct?\n<SturmFlut> zubozrout, akiva-thinkpad: At least at the moment there isn't any information regarding the MX5, and Ubuntu also doesn't officially run on 64-bit ARM yet. I've asked about 64-bit ARM, because it would be nice if the Convergence device by bq came with it, but no info.\n<mzanetti> mivoligo, yep\n<akiva-thinkpad> SturmFlut: 64bit would just add a bit more speed, and +2gb of ram? or is it different than x86?\n<mivoligo> mzanetti: ok, so   \"automaticOrientation: false\" is no longer supported?\n<mzanetti> exactly\n<zubozrout> SturmFlut: Hmm, well, it sounds like I shouldn't hold my breath if there is no 64bit ARM support yet. So even if MX5 is going to be available with Ubuntu it won't be that soon as I want it to be, right?\n<SturmFlut> akiva-thinkpad: The AArch64 mode of ARMv8 is completely different than ARMv7. It's not an extension, it's a new design.\n<mivoligo> mzanetti: btw what about the lock screen, does it rotate as well?\n<popey> mivoligo: haha, no\n<akiva-thinkpad> SturmFlut: sounds complex~\n<popey> mivoligo: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1471609\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 1471609 in unity8 (Ubuntu) \"Cannot unlock phone in landscape\" [Critical,Confirmed]\n<mivoligo> popey: :D\n<mzanetti> ^^\n<mivoligo> mzanetti: are you planning to update MvsM any time soon?\n<Mirv> zbenjamin: yeah, fun, SDK works just fine as long as I don't touch the laptop's internal touchpad :S\n<mzanetti> mivoligo, probably yes\n<mivoligo> mzanetti: I'll try to update that level 23 and push it in the evening then\n<mzanetti> ok\n<SturmFlut> akiva-thinkpad: Okay, I was wrong I hear, the bq Convergence device should be 64-bit :)\n<akiva-thinkpad> SturmFlut: So the Aquarius that is released is 64bit?\n<ogra_> SturmFlut, who told you that ?\n<ogra_> (then it cant be arm )\n<zubozrout> ogra_: akiva-thinkpad ment 64bit arm\n<akiva-thinkpad> Well its all greek to me\n<akiva-thinkpad> havn't been following hte arm hardware scene.\n<akiva-thinkpad> the*\n<ogra_> well, thats more a software issue :)\n<ogra_> only about 60% of the phone packages even build on arm64 yet\n<zubozrout> ogra_: So it is in works to support arm64?\n<ogra_> the ubuntu archive has arm64 support since ages already ...\n<akiva-thinkpad> meh, all I care about is autopilot... and why trunk fails for me, but not for jenkins.\n<ogra_> but the packages havent been fixed to build on it ...\n<ogra_> nobody bothered\n<ogra_> partialkly they even have arm64 completely disabled\n<ogra_> getting that fixed and getting arm64 images at all will be quite some developer effort that will draw a lot of manpower\n<zubozrout> ogra_: Well, this answers my question about MX5 releasing with Ubuntu :).

How does the PPA build system achieve this?\n<mcphail> which apt mirror hosts armhf binaries?\n<ogra_> ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports\n<mcphail> ogra_: cheers\n<popey> mcphail: I'm tempted to buy a cheap arm chromebook for doing stuff like this\n<mcphail> popey: I'm 95.989% of the way to solving it\n<popey> \\o/\n<popey> can you make an image and put it online somewhere? :)\n<mcphail> popey: yep\n<popey> \\o/\n<mcphail> popey: if it works...\n<popey> we have faith in you\n<popey> is it working yet?\n<popey> etc\n<mcphail> the \"royal\" we?\n<popey> ya\n<popey> renatu: when you get a moment - https://bugs.launchpad.net/sync-monitor/+bug/1472973  - one of the insiders reported issues syncing\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 1472973 in sync-monitor \"calendar fails to sync google calendar\" [Undecided,New]\n<renatu> popey, thanks, I added a comment on the bug report\n<mcphail> popey: my base image is 693M. Don't think I'm going to be able to host that anywhere useful. Would be faster for anyone to reproduce the build...\n<popey> mcphail: if it's reproducible I can do that and host it\n<popey> ping me the instructions and I'll take a look\n<mcphail> popey: in channel or in /msg?\n<popey> whatever :)\n<popey> a paste somewhere or something is fine\n<mcphail> popey: hokay\n<popey> ta\n<mcphail> popey: think this covers it - http://paste.ubuntu.com/11848280/ . That should give a base armhf vivid install. Would need to add the development packages etc\n<popey> kk, thanks\n<mcphail> popey: gzipped base image is about 350MB\n<mcphail> qemu-user-static is a great little invention\n<popey> ya\n<mcphail> Is the Ubuntu-SDK PPA built for ARM?\n<popey> mcphail: the ppa has that enabled, yes\n<mcphail> good\n<mcphail> If I don't install the SDK, is the \"click\" package in the standard repos sufficient to build phone packages?\n<popey> mcphail: I don't always build click packages, but when I do, I use the ppa.\n<mcphail> ok, I'll see how I get on\n<popey> jhodapp: question - we now have the ability for apps to intelligently prevent screen off (e.g. in a game) - how about in mediaplayer - when watchin a video in a browser, I don't want the screen to go off.\n<popey> is that on your roadmap?\n<jhodapp> popey, the oxide team is actually adding that right now\n<popey> sweet!\n<mcphail> nemo: ping\n<nemo> mcphail: \\o/\n<nemo> got it working??\n<mcphail> nemo: need to remind me of the tweaks you want\n<nemo> mcphail: set MOBILE flag in build, and delete line 43 of hedgewars/options.inc\n<mcphail> nemo: great. I'm on it\n<nemo> cool\n * nemo crosses fingers\n<nemo> mcphail: just to doublecheck. line 43 is the HWENGINE one \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<nemo> since the desktop frontend expects a separate process right now\n<nemo> er\n<nemo> HWLIBRARY\n<mcphail> CMake Warning: Manually-specified variables were not used by the project: MOBILE - is that a problem?\n<mcphail> (btw, I'm using the source tarball in this chroot rather than the git repo...)\n<jhodapp> popey, here's the MR in fact: https://code.launchpad.net/~justinmcp/oxide/1328494/+merge/263998\n<nemo> mcphail: ack\n<nemo> srs?\n<nemo> hm\n<nemo> wierd...\n<nemo> mcphail: checking cmake setup for engine\n<nemo> also pinging koda\n<nemo> mcphail: since we shifted engine to use cmake build it has had more weird issues and a bit more opaque a build process\n<nemo> (like failing to rebuild on code changes \u00e2\u0098\u00b9 )\n<mcphail> nemo: that's a big problem for a build system...\n<nemo> no kidding\n<nemo> spent like an hour once trying to figure out why the hell my change wasn't fixing a bug\n<nemo> before the obv occurred to me\n<nemo> well this is frustrating. I don't see any toggle in CMakeLists.txt for this. might have to manually add it to that file \u00e2\u0098\u00b9\n<nemo> but let me poke koda about this\n<nemo> mcphail: that is, I don't see a add_definitions(-dMOBILE) anywhere\n<mcphail> Bah - it has linked against SDL1.2 :(\n<nemo> mcphail: only desktop version\n<nemo> mcphail: mobile has always built against SDL2\n<nemo> mcphail: the CMakeLists.txt already has:\n<nemo> if(${SDL_VERSION} VERSION_GREATER 1.3)                                                                                   add_definitions(-dSDL2)\n<nemo> endif()\n<nemo> but SDL2 is enabled if you can set MOBILE\n<nemo> hopefully linking is same. seems to be\n<mcphail> nemo: I just used \"-DMOBILE=1\" as a build flag. Was that the correct way?\n<nemo> mcphail: that's for a cmake flag, but I don't see it being passed on to the engine there\n<nemo> mcphail: I *thought* our CMakeLists.txt would have relayed it. that's what's annoying me\n<nemo> I'm thinking the lack of mobile devs in past few years has triggered bitrot as koda messed w/ CMake\n<nemo> mcphail: you could just add add_definitions(-dMOBILE)  to hedgewars/CMakeLists.txt for now\n<nemo> pending consulting w/ him on this\n<nemo> maybe just above add_definitions(-dDEBUGFILE)\n<nemo> on line 209\n<mcphail> nemo: do I need to delete the Makefile after changing CMakeLists.txt?\n<nemo> mcphail: should detect the change\n<nemo> if you rerun cmake\n<nemo> hell. if you run make\n<mcphail> ok :)\n<nemo> mcphail: what worries me though, is because this is required, it makes me think the CMakeLists.txt currently has no mobile support. which is bad for linking\n<nemo> mcphail: I do hope since we ocassionally screw around with SDL2 that that should work at least \u00e2\u0098\u00b9\n<mcphail> nemo: I'm going to do a clean build because this is throwing multiple errors\n<nemo> find_package(SDL1or2)\n<nemo> hopefully it finds 2 \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<mcphail> nemo: getting stuck with this one: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11849555/ - any ideas? At least (I think) this suggests it is using SDL2...\n<nemo> oh good\n<nemo> mcphail: that means it is hitting the MOBILE block in the engine which is adding the gles11 unit\n<nemo> mcphail: now, in the old android build, a gles11.pp was provieded in project_files/Android-build but ideally we'd get this from ubuntu's package management\n<nemo> mcphail: I'm checking to see if you guys do in fact package this anywhere \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<nemo> mcphail: otherwise we could toss it into the dir\n<mcphail> ok\n<sheepluva> nemo: as I said. I don't have any particular knowledge on the issue. but figured can't hurt to hang out here :P\n<nemo> hi sheepluva\n<nemo> trying to coax koda here but apparently hectic day at work for him\n<nemo> hum... not finding it anywhere \u00e2\u0098\u00b9\n<sheepluva> 18:26 <@koda> needs gles11 unit\n<sheepluva> 18:26 <@koda> should be checked under fpc unit folder\n<nemo> sheepluva: the only gles11 unit I have is that android custom one\n<nemo> it binds against     External_library='GLESv1_CM'; {Setup as you need}\n<nemo>     Loadgles11('libGLESv1_CM.so');\n<nemo> sheepluva: so those would need changing at a minimum\n<nemo> mcphail: hm.. does ubuntu touch need gles11? \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<nemo> sheepluva: you know, this kinda surprises me 'cause I thought we were using GLES11 across the board now\n<mcphail> nemo: I honestly don'y know :)\n<sheepluva> {$IFDEF MOBILE}                                                                                                                             {$DEFINE HWLIBRARY}\n<sheepluva>  {$DEFINE GLunit:=gles11}                                                                                                                {$DEFINE USE_LANDSCAPE_AMMOMENU}                                                                                                        {$DEFINE USE_TOUCH_INTERFACE}\n<sheepluva> {$ELSE}\n<nemo> sheepluva: boooo\n<nemo> sheepluva: 1) we got that far already, 2) pastebin \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u009d\n<mcphail> nemo: off to do some domestic chores for a while. If you get a solution, I'll catch it in the /lastlog\n<sheepluva> does the build destination? the ubuntu touch thing? doesn't have regular gl?\n<nemo> sheepluva: well ubuntu touch targets mobile devices, so I'm gonna guess GLES is standard on the device. but I had no idea if maybe it had an abstraction layer or something\n<nemo> sheepluva: also, I know that MOBILE sets gles11 but I wasn't sure if that was redundant or not\n<koda> hi\n<nemo> sorry\n<nemo> well. eyeballing the flag, seems gles11 only impacts our code in extension loading\n<nemo> so. assuming opengl apps normally build on an ubuntu touch, and opengl is available..\n<nemo> gonna guess we could maybe remove GLunit:=gles11 and, possibly if it causes a problem on startup, kill the extension loading\n<nemo> we don't use it for anything important anyway\n<nemo> video recording and 3d rendering\n<nemo> mcphail: ok. you mind deleting that line too? \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<koda> mcphail: you mean that you are using full fledged gl unit in fpc ? :o\n<mr-tt> hi\n<mr-tt> how can i create a button in qml for ubuntu touch?\n<nemo> koda: well... my problem was that the gles11 stuff seemed custom to android (and maybe iOS)\n<nemo> koda: gles11 isn't provided by the system\n<nemo> so I was hoping we could get away w/ full gl unit\n<koda> no it's custom to *mobile* opengl\n<koda> there are missing functions between gles11 and gl\n<nemo> koda: I mean gles11.pp is under Android-build\n<nemo> koda: uh. why isn't that reflected in the code?\n<nemo> only thing that gles11 seems to flag is extension loading\n<nemo> I thought we targeted GLES11 across the board\n<nemo> and that it was a subset of full gl\n<koda> because the code uses gles11 which matches gl1.0\n<koda> so it works fine on desktop and amobile\n<nemo> koda: right? thought that's what I was saying\n<nemo> koda: but my point is... if system has gl unit in fpc, then it should just work if gles11 unit is deleted\n<nemo> koda: if it doesn't, because ubuntu touch has phone issues on that front, then will need to adapt the android build unit right?\n<nemo> since I couldn't find an ubuntu package explicitly for it, like, say, fp-unit-gles\n<koda> i don't think so, gles11 comes bundled in the arm fpc package afair\n<nemo> oh realllly\n<nemo> then he should not have gotten a build error eh\n<koda> it depends how the fpc pkg is distributed on ubuntu mobile :p\n * nemo pokes mcphail \n<nemo> you mind checking to see if gles11 is under the fpc tree on your build machine?\n<nemo> or, for that matter, any gl unit at all?\n<nemo> that is, under /usr/lib/fpc/*/units probably\n<nemo> koda: the thing is, I *think* this package already exists for ubuntu touch\n<nemo> so that suggests someone is building the entire ecosystem\n<nemo> well. maybe I misunderstood.\n<mcphail> nemo: no gles under /usr/lib/fpc/ anywhere\n<nemo> perhaps it is just packaged for arm, and if it works under ubuntu touch is just luck\n<nemo> mcphail: how about opengl\n<mcphail> nemo: yes - but can't use that on phone\n<nemo> bleh\n<nemo> mcphail: ok... so. the android build used a custom gles11.pp that added bindings against a gles so\n<nemo> it would be *nice* if ubuntu could package this in fashion koda mentioned \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<nemo> but failing that, could do it manually I guess\n<mcphail> nemo: :)\n<nemo> mcphail: I was kinda hoping that possibly ubuntu was providing an opengl stub against gles11 - for apps that might possibly work w/ it.\n<nemo> mcphail: hm...\n<nemo> koda: hey. question.\n<nemo> koda: if the build was against the gl fpc, but we only used gles11 routines...\n<nemo> er. wait. no... would require the gl lib to target the phone gles. nm\n<nemo> guess that unit isn't even built for touch\n<nemo> probably would be missing stuff\n<mcphail> nemo: I don't know anything about pascal so can't offer any suggestions\n<nemo> mcphail: well... if I knew the name of the gles11 library on the phone could try adapting https://code.google.com/p/hedgewars/source/browse/project_files/Android-build/gles11.pp I guess \u00e2\u0098\u00b9\n<nemo> mcphail: could file a bug against ubuntu touch asking for that mobile targetted arm package, but I guess that's lol\n<mcphail> nemo: just the name of the package giving the C libs for gles?\n<nemo> mcphail: well... reading that gles11.pp says it was automatically generated\n<nemo> but, most of it seems pretty generic\n<nemo> so I was hoping I could simply update Loadgles11('libGLESv1_CM.so'); to be your libgles name\n<nemo> then toss gles11.pp into hedgewars/\n<nemo> or well. have you do both of those \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u009d\n<mcphail> libGLESv2.so.2.0.0 and libGLESv1_CM.so.1.1.0\n<nemo> ooooh\n<nemo> srs!\n<nemo> cool. so maybe don't have to do anything\n<nemo> I bet libGLESv1_CM.so.1.1.0 is probably symlinked to libGLESv1_CM.so\n<nemo> mcphail: ok. cp project_files/Android-build/gles11.pp hedgewars/\n<nemo> aaaand cross fingers I guess\n<mcphail> nemo: well, we get a _different_ error :)\n<nemo> yay\n<nemo> \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u009d\n<koda> nebtw the gles11.pp is just a copy of the fpc version, so there is no problem in bundling for ubuntu touch imho\n<mcphail> nemo: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11849907/\n<nemo> hmmm\n<nemo> \u00e2\u0099\u00a5 hg grep\n<nemo> is teh awesome\n<nemo> specifically hg grep --all\n<nemo> thought so. sheepluva added that last june\n<nemo> symptom of bitrot in our mobile stuff\n<nemo> good news tho\n<nemo> mcphail: he just failed to ifdef enough I think\n<nemo> {$IFDEF USE_S3D_RENDERING OR USE_VIDEO_RECORDING}\n<mcphail> aah.\n<nemo> is around the body of the createframebuffer\n<nemo> but not the header\n<mcphail> nemo: paste me a patch or new file and I'll switch it around\n<nemo> mcphail: hm...\n<nemo> mcphail: well. I'm not sure what you are using. the branch?\n<nemo> I just want that ifdef above around those 2 calls\n<nemo> on your lines 81 and 82 of uRender\n<nemo> mcphail: 0.9.21 + ubuntu patches?\n<mcphail> nemo: just the 0.9.21 tarball from the site\n<nemo> 'k\n<nemo> hang on then\n<mcphail> can I just comment those lines out?\n<nemo> you could, but I was testing locally and hit another one\n<nemo> USE_S3D_RENDERING is not enabled for mobile, and RenderClear has same issue\n<nemo> procedure RenderClear           (mode: TRenderMode);\n<nemo> will need that too\n<nemo> ugh. DrawWorld too. maaaan\n<nemo> mcphail: ok. made some minor changes to dev for those flags\n<nemo> mcphail: going to transplant them into the .21 branch and pack 'em up for you as a diff\n<nemo> just eyeballing it *seems* like the game should still work just w/ the ifdef tweaks \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<nemo> transplant 'cause I think the branch is too old to merge anymore\n<SturmFlut> Months ago we couldn't even get SDL working, and now you guys are working on the third SDL game port I know of. Oh wow.\n<nemo> mcphail: ok. builds w/ s3d and video recording turned off now. transplanted it onto the branch. but not worth you getting it I think\n<nemo> mcphail: simply disabling those 2 lines is enough on the branch. all the rest is in .22-dev\n<nemo> well. \"the rest\" one more function and a compiler error in uWorld\n<nemo> https://code.google.com/p/hedgewars/source/detail?r=a0b9b678b46eccd0c66273c4f6bb016b9586d2be&name=0.9.21  fwiw\n<nemo> but nice to get mobile bitrot under control again \\o/\n<nemo> mcphail: we need to properly support MOBILE as a cmake flag, and maybe provide gles11 if the system isn't providing it\n<nemo> don't want to add gles11.pp outright ofc, to avoid overriding system version\n<mcphail> nemo: was afk. Give me a minute and I'll check that out\n<nemo> SturmFlut: TBH I thought this was just gonna be flip a flag and go \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<nemo> SturmFlut: or I would have probably stayed in my channel \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u009d\n<nemo> but nice to see all that mobile work from iOS and Android days so many years ago actually get some use\n<nemo> mcphail: hm... gotta go in a couple of minutes\n<nemo> or I'l get stuck in traffic for sure and miss kid's class\n<mcphail> nemo: np - will have to go soon anyway. Got a bit further then - http://paste.ubuntu.com/11850158/\n<nemo> huh...\n<nemo> koda: \u00e2\u0086\u0091\n<nemo> don't see where that should be coming from\n<nemo> but gotta go\n<koda> nemo: 365:            fingers[index].id := nilFingerId;\n<koda> some leftover probably\n<koda> mcphail: should be enough to remove it\n<mcphail> ok - it compiles but I'm now getting a raft of SDL linker errors. Might have to give up on this for the evening\n<mcphail> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11850217/\n * mcphail gives up for the evening and decides to _play_ hedgewars instead\n<popey> hah\n<popey> thats the spirit\n<mr-tt> how do i write to a file and read from it in an app? ./file doesn't seem to work\n<mr-tt> i suppose i need to specify a path where writing is allowed. but where is that?\n<mcphail> It would be brilliant to get this game on the phone.

so nothing gets hidden\n<zsombi> mr-tt: these will push your view content up\n<mr-tt> zsombi: do you have a code example? and how can i test this on a desktop?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: we are also trying to have this behavior in a component that you can use to do these automatically, its just gonna take some time and will (hopefully) land in uitk 1.3\n<zsombi> mr-tt: you cannot really test this on desktop, only on phone\n<zsombi> as desktop doesn;t have OSK\n<mr-tt> heard there are osk for desktop too\n<zsombi> mr-tt: but that OSK is not per app...\n<zsombi> so it's not gonna appear in your app's window\n<zsombi> afaik\n<mr-tt> dunno, someone used osk together with xmir+x apps\n<zsombi> ok, I had not seen that, but if it comes in your app's window (which I doubth) then you can test them both on your desktp and phone\n<mr-tt> zsombi: how do i watch the inputmethods in code?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: Qt.inputMethod is a QInputMethod object, so you can do binding, connect its signals, etc\n<zsombi> mr-tt: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qinputmethod.html\n<mr-tt> zsombi: do i do that from c++ or can i do it all in qml? not sure\n<zsombi> mr-tt: all its properties/signals/slots/invokables are visible in QML :)\n<mr-tt> ok\n<mr-tt> zsombi: do you also know how to define platform specific #imports in qml?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: no way\n<mr-tt> hum that sucks a bit\n<zsombi> mr-tt: well, can you do that in JS?\n<mr-tt> zsombi: no idea how to\n<zsombi> mr-tt: you cannot :)\n<mr-tt> zsombi: i read on the web it's possible in the meantime, but it didn't work\n<zsombi> mr-tt: but it depends on what do you want to do, you can do these platform specific things in C++ and expose to QML only a common layer\n<mr-tt> zsombi: https://forum.qt.io/topic/5739/platform-specific-part-of-qml-file/14\n<mr-tt> last answer\n<zsombi> mr-tt: aaah, but that is not an import\n<mr-tt> zsombi: code example on how to do that?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: that si a runtime check, and it shoudl work\n<zsombi> mr-tt: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-qt.html\n<zsombi> mr-tt: I guess you copied the @ stuff too :)\n<mr-tt> yes\n<zsombi> mr-tt: wel, that's the problem :)\n<zsombi> http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-qt.html#platform-prop\n<zsombi> mr-tt: try this if (Qt.platform.os === \"linux\" || Qt.platform.os === \"windows\" || Qt.platform.os === \"osx\" || Qt.platform.os === \"unix\") {\n<zsombi> /..\n<zsombi> }\n<zsombi> mr-tt: the @ is causing syntax error\n<mr-tt> i tried wihtout the @ too,neither works\n<zsombi> mr-tt: have you tried to print the Qt.platform.os before the statement?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: maybe the string is none of yours you check\n<mr-tt> zsombi: no, how to do that?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: either print(Qt.platform.os) or console.log()\n<mr-tt> zsombi: Unexpected token `if'\n<zsombi> mr-tt: could you pastebin your code pls?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: pastebin.ubuntu.com\n<mr-tt> zsombi: http://pastebin.com/gdcUikq7\n<mr-tt> guess i have to put that if function elsewhere?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: ok, how much you know about Qt/QML? :)\n<mr-tt> zsombi: heh not so much :)\n<zsombi> mr-tt: I guessed :D\n<zsombi> mr-tt: so, first, in order a QML document to work properly, you need an Item\n<mr-tt> zsombi: oh that's not my whole code\n<zsombi> mr-tt: you can put property declarations, do property bindings there\n<mr-tt> just the header of the file\n<mr-tt> with the imports\n<mr-tt> of course there are items etc later on\n<zsombi> mr-tt: ok, np, but as the if() statement si not a declaration statement, you have to put it into a functoin or a JS code\n<zsombi> mr-tt: as said, you cannot do platform specific imports\n<mr-tt> ok then it's no use doing this in a function\n<zsombi> mr-tt: the sequence you pasted from a link is a runtime statement, does runtime OS check\n<zsombi> mr-tt: it doesn't do OS specific imports\n<zsombi> mr-tt: but it can solve OS specific code execution\n<mr-tt> zsombi: how can i make sure it imports ubuntu components then instead of qml controls?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: you need to use named import\n<mr-tt> zsombi: how is that done?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: and then use that namespace in all QtQuick Controls  (or UITK controls) used\n<zsombi> mr-tt: import Ubuntu.Components 1.2 as Toolkit\n<mr-tt> zsombi: but that would duplicate my qml code?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: the \"as Toolkit\" can be anything\n<zsombi> mr-tt: well, it depends what you want to do... it won't duplicate, but if you want to mix the QtQuick controls Button with UITK Button, then you have to do this\n<zsombi> mr-tt: the named import is only needed when you use components from the two modules with the same name\n<zsombi> mr-tt: otherwise not\n<mr-tt> well i just want to write +test on a nonubuntu machine with qtquick controls and then compile with components instead on a ubuntu machine\n<mr-tt> i simply replaced controls import with components and it pretty much worked\n<mr-tt> zsombi: because utouch doesnt have controls\n<zsombi> uhm\n<zsombi> I don't get you\n<mr-tt> zsombi: import QtQuick.Controls 1.3 doesn't work on utouch, because it can't find it\n<mr-tt> import Ubuntu.Components 1.2 works\n<zsombi> mr-tt: 1.3 is not yet released, so you will get them only with dev-proposed images\n<mr-tt> lol so import QtQuick.Controls 1.3 would work? alright then :)\n<mr-tt> import QtQuick.Controls 1.2 *\n<zsombi> mr-tt: ahh, sorry, I got mixed\n<zsombi> mr-tt: QtQuick.Controls is NOT supported on the device\n<zsombi> at least we do not support that\n<mr-tt> zsombi: why not? :/\n<zsombi> mr-tt: I wanted to say Ubuntu.Components 1.3 :D\n<zsombi> mr-tt: because there are plenty of things don not work yet with QtQuick.Controls in utouch\n<mr-tt> zsombi: how come? utouch components seems to be pretty much the same like qt controls?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: so, Ubuntu.Components 1.2 is stable release, Ubuntu.Components 1.3 is dev release\n<zsombi> mr-tt: yes, but those are only few swhich are the same\n<mr-tt> i was talking about QT controls 1.3 not utouch components 1.\u00c2\u00a7\n<mr-tt> 3*\n<zsombi> mr-tt: modal windows, such as Dialog, Menu don;t work, they segfault\n<zsombi> mr-tt: Mir doesn't support those yet\n<zsombi> so we cannot support Qt controls then\n<mr-tt> zsombi: ah ok but in the future, any idea when that'll be?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: I had not seen any plans to support Qt controls, especially that they are moving to QtQuick.Controls2\n<mr-tt> zsombi: but 2 will be supported?\n<mr-tt> zsombi: do you use qtcreator/ubuntusdk?\n<popey> mr-tt: he works on it\n<mr-tt> anyone knows how to hide the debugger view after one brought it up?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: in QtCreator, do you see the Debug button on the left vertical bar highlighted_\n<zsombi> ?\n<mr-tt> zsombi: aah thanks, i couldn't figure that one out\n<zsombi> mr-tt: :)\n<mr-tt> zsombi: is it planned to release the usdk for other distros or even platforms?\n<zsombi> mr-tt: yes\n<mr-tt> ok very good :)\n<zsombi> mr-tt: some things may not work on platfirms, which are d-bus based, but we are going to find a way to get a symulation on those if possible\n<nemo> mcphail: goood mornin\n<mcphail> nemo: Hi. I'm going to be afk (on and off) for the next couple of weeks. Wondered if you wanted a copy of the development chroot for your game, so you can work on it?\n<nemo> hm\n<nemo> wellllll\n<nemo> the interesting part was getting it packaged up\n<nemo> and seems you just have to fix some SDL link error at this point\n<mcphail> nemo: np - I'll have another look at it when I get back\n<nemo> was figuring I'd just get someone here who is an ubuntu developer to maybe get it to that point\n<sturmflut> Hmpf, I offered Deutsche Bahn to build and maintain a clone of their \"DB Navigator\" app for Ubuntu, until they decide to offer an official one. They declined to even talk to me about that.\n<sturmflut> ogra_: ^^\n<ogra_> you mean they didnt answer or did they actively decline ?\n<sturmflut> ogra_: The answer was \"Thanks, but if we find there is a need for it, our experts surely can build it themselves.\"\n<JanC> I thought there already is one in the store?\n<ogra_> lol\n<JanC> unofficial\n<ogra_> arrogante arschloecher :P\n<sturmflut> JanC: Yeah, mine, but it's just a pimped-up container around some websites. The most important features are missing.\n<ogra_> do they offer a public api ?\n<JanC> ah, right, I remembered seeing something while scrolling through the store\n<sturmflut> ogra_: No. I've reverse-engineered most of it though.\n * ogra_ would just go ahead and write it anyway (with its own logo and name perhaps)\n<sturmflut> ogra_: Yeah, that's what Fahrplan does, and it will probably not be an issue as long as you just use the search API to display connections. But we are all after the ticketing API. I want to buy a ticket and show it to the conductor, on my Ubuntu phone.\n<sturmflut> Well, at least sync the tickets I've already bought and display them\n<ogra_> well, you could screen-scrape ... ugly but would surely work ... in the end you only get a qr code anyway\n<sturmflut> Oh, I've already reverse-engineered most of the ticket API as well ;) In the end you authenticate and download a couple of PNGs and some text, the QR code being one of the PNGs.\n<sturmflut> But that's the point where it gets ugly.\n<ogra_> i assume all the payment stuff is ugly ...\n<sturmflut> If the connection search doesn't work, everybody will blame your app and that's it. It's not a business critical feature. But buying things and \"authenticating\" to a conductor touches the core business of Deutsche Bahn. And if there's an error, people may start calling the DB hotline and ask what's the problem.\n<sturmflut> At that point DB *will* go after me, regardless if I use their name/logo or not.\n<ogra_> well, that would at least get ther attention :P\n<ogra_> for the demand :)\n<sturmflut> Hehe\n<ogra_> but yeah, you might get sued\n<sturmflut> I wouldn't even really mind the lawsuit, sometimes you have to step up against such nonsense. Even banks allow you to do all your banking using third-party applications, so why shouldn't I be able to give DB my money using a third-party app?\n<sturmflut> But this is germany, there's no chance I can win this.\n<nemo> mcphail: FWIW\n<nemo> 09:54 <@koda> he should really use make VERBOSE=1\n<nemo> 09:54 <@koda> anyway not sure, he probably didn't change the linker names\n<nemo> 09:54 <@koda> in sdlh\n<nemo> decent chance that might be the last *build* error \u00e2\u0098\u00ba\n<sturmflut> ogra_: I'll answer DB with a more explicit question. They \"officially\" tolerate an iPhone app called \"nextr\", which queries their connection database through their API. So they surely can \"tolerate\" me too? :P\n<nemo> sturmflut: querying sounds less risky than making payments\n<nemo> maybe they are being paranoid\n<nemo> which is always safe stance if you ask a manager or lawyer anything\n<nemo> easier to say no\n<sturmflut> nemo: I think I might be able to go into some kind of \"grey area\" if I do everything except the payment process. Then you have to book a ticket using the website, but can sync it to your phone and show it to the conductor later. Still not as nice as the original, but at least it works.\n<sturmflut> You usually book tickets beforehand from your desktop, and you should be able to use the full website from a phone, so all uses are covered\n<nemo> sturmflut: well... take for example Android\n<nemo> sturmflut: if I use my older phone, and I browse to a ticket site in Firefox - perfectly safe\n<nemo> if I use basically any web app, I now suffer from the XSS injection that Google refuses to backport the fix for\n<nemo> I mean... app that uses a web view\n<nemo> but, I bet their reason is entirely about control and how easy it is to say no.\n<nemo> sturmflut: \"Easier to ask forgiveness than permission\" \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u009d\n<sturmflut> I think they have two concerns\n<sturmflut> The first is that the payment API could he hacked\n<sturmflut> The second is that if they allow everybody to query their data, including ticket prices, people could easily build price comparison websites, and would often notice that some other operator or means of transportation is cheaper\n<nemo> heh\n<nemo> sturmflut: hm. those kinds of querying scrapers are already legal no?\n<nemo> also, I thought you were doing transactions, not just querying\n<JanC> sturmflut: in Belgium (most?) banks only allow one (or maybe a couple) very expensive business bridges outside of their own website/apps...  :-(\n<JanC> so you're lucky in Germany\n<karni> FTR, telegram may be experiencing temporary problems.\n<karni> Result: {\"_\":\"rpc_error\",\"error_code\":-503,\"error_message\":\"Timeout\"}\n<mcphail> nemo: cheers - I'll look at that when I get a chance\n<sturmflut> nemo: It's legal to scrape the website up to some \"degree\", and the \"degree\" has never really been defined. There are some search engines by now that can compare all means of transportation, including trains, but they all have official cooperations with DB.\n<sturmflut> JanC: No HCBI?\n<nemo> sturmflut: I guess if they wanted to legally ban scraping they'd just add a robots.txt line\n<sturmflut> nemo: A robots.txt has never been legally binding.\n<nemo> depends on the country I think\n<nemo> since it communicates intention\n<nemo> hm\n<nemo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/999056/ethics-of-robots-txt\n<nemo> http://www.bna.com/legal-issues-raised-by-the-use-of-web-crawling-and-scraping-tools-for-analytics-purposes/  this one notes courts have considered robots.txt as a factor\n<nemo> the stack overflow discussion using analogy of a no tresspassing sign\n<nemo> or at least a no automated tresspassing I guess\n<ahoneybun> wait is there a new sound for notifications?\n<JanC> sturmflut: HCBI ?\n<sturmflut> JanC: That's a standard interface for banking\n<JanC> sturmflut: maybe some banks support that for businesses, certainly not for regular people...\n<JanC> or maybe the bridge software supports it\n<JanC> and even Wikipedia doesn't know it  ;)\n<sturmflut> Errr, HBCI\n<sturmflut> Oh, it exists only in germany\n<sturmflut> I always thought it was an european thing\n<ahoneybun> hey all how would I list these in my app: http://fullcirclemagazine.org/downloads/\n<ahoneybun> ?\n<nemo> sturmflut: my vague recollection from many decades ago, when people were more trusting  was that you'd (totally generic you \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u009d)  occasionally stumble across these thingies when wardialing that appeared to be wide open bank interfaces for interbank communication\n<nemo> they were like 300 baud or something\n<nemo> s/many/several/\n<sturmflut> ahoneybun: The easiest thing is a QML WebView. The more complex thing is a C++ QML component that parses the HTML site, but parsing HTML usually sucks. So I would suggest that you use http://fullcirclemagazine.org/feed/ instead and use a QML XmlListModel to parse it.\n<ahoneybun> sturmflut: I've got the feed working, I just want to make it possible to view what issues there are and offer to download them\n<nemo> sturmflut: for Hedgewars we serve http://hedgewars.org/content.html inside the game by doing a basic chopping of the page HTML\n<ahoneybun> then use document viewer to see the pdf\n<sturmflut> ahoneybun: Yep\n<ahoneybun> sturmflut: seems i could just have a list with urls like this: http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issue1_en.pdf and then it will open the browser but then it asks if you want to use Document Viewer :)\n<JanC> sturmflut: seems like exactly one small Belgian bank supports it\n<JanC> probably accidentally because of the on-line banking software they use  ;)\n<nemo> sturmflut: oh. and QTextBrowser - is a lot more lightweight than WebView\n<nemo> sturmflut: fewer deps too\n<ahoneybun> and that works\n<sturmflut> ahoneybun: You could probably use the QML Ubuntu.SingleDownload component to download an issue and then open it with the Content Hub, which will offer to open it with the Document Viewer\n<ahoneybun> cool\n<ahoneybun> I'll look into that\n<sturmflut> \\o/\n<ahoneybun> can I hook that into a List?\n<sturmflut> To download more than one file at once?\n<nemo> https://code.google.com/p/hedgewars/source/browse/QTfrontend/ui/page/pagedata.cpp and https://code.google.com/p/hedgewars/source/browse/QTfrontend/ui/widget/databrowser.h\n<ahoneybun> well if you click the one list item (ex. issue 3) it would download and offer to open document viewer\n<sturmflut> ahoneybun: Yep\n<ahoneybun> sweet\n<ahoneybun> thanks sturmflut\n<sturmflut> ahoneybun: See if it works first ;)\n<ahoneybun> there is a full circle app but it is a webapp, and this well be a full Native app\n<ahoneybun> I would have never thought of it anyway\n<ahoneybun> sturmflut: https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/apps/qml/sdk-15.04/Ubuntu.DownloadManager.SingleDownload/ ?\n<sturmflut> ahoneybun: Should be it, yes\n * sturmflut goes to find something for dinner\n<ahoneybun> using the sample from there crashes the app when I push download\n<ahoneybun> mhall119: any exp with Ubuntu.DownloadManager?\n<ahoneybun> t1mp: ping\n<t1mp> ahoneybun:

popey about it, but the problem is you guys need translation support https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail/issues/96\n<ahayzen> davidcalle, a few client sites do actually have translated content at the moment, but the implementation is fuggerly, so it would be better for something 'proper' to be made\n<ahayzen> i talked with a few devs yesterday about it and they said its high on their priority list but will probably be v1.1+ (1.0 is about to be released)\n<davidcalle> ahayzen, we do, that's what motivated going with django CMS\n<ahayzen> davidcalle, unless you want to help the guy in the issue

GNU/Linux\n<ahoneybun> I have a device so I don't use it\n<ahoneybun> That is 32 bit\n<ahoneybun> 15.04\n<robert__> yes but my phone is new, i don't want to broke it :-)\n<robert__> 15.04\n<ahoneybun> What phone?\n<robert__> Meizu MX4\n<ahoneybun> Oh the Ubuntu one?\n<robert__> yes\n<robert__> i freezed it once already ...\n<robert__> and i can't have my contact from the sim :-(\n<ahoneybun> You can run the app on the phone without installing anything\n<ahoneybun> Once you kill the app it is gone\n<robert__> ok, i'll give it a try later\n<ahoneybun> Cool\n<robert__> but it does not solve my actual problem\n<ahoneybun> Your on the stable?\n<robert__> why is the emulator don't boot up\n<robert__> yes\n<robert__> stable\n<ahoneybun> Yea it should work\n<ahoneybun> hey akiva-thinkpad\n<ahoneybun> holy crap\n<ahoneybun> I got 100 downloads in 1 day!\n<akiva-thinkpad> ahoneybun: o/\n<ahoneybun> hows it going akiva-thinkpad\n<akiva-thinkpad> ahoneybun: well, the Autopilot plugin is basically finished with the SDK, so ive been looking for another projects in ubuntu to contribute to.\n<ahoneybun> I saw that\n<akiva-thinkpad> ahoneybun: :)\n<ahoneybun> tbh don't understand autopilot\n<ahoneybun> akiva-thinkpad: have you used DownloadManager?\n<akiva-thinkpad> ahoneybun: what don't you understand?\n<akiva-thinkpad> and no\n<bzoltan_> akiva-thinkpad: I am holiday, so I am brainwashed :) but what was zbenjamin and your last discussion about?\n<ahoneybun> I don't what it is for, as in how is it different then running it in a emulator or real hw\n<akiva-thinkpad> bzoltan_: can't remember tbh. I think he said he was busy, so we merged, and won't be bothering with pushing this up to qtcreator for now\n<bzoltan_> akiva-thinkpad: because it is available in the SDK PPA as separate package... I wonder what is the blocker to integrate it\n<akiva-thinkpad> bzoltan_: When using it, if you want a feature added, just file a bug report.\n<akiva-thinkpad> bzoltan_: wait, there is a deb available for it? Neat~\n<bzoltan_> akiva-thinkpad: I made it :) but it would be fun to integrate it as real part of the SDK\n<akiva-thinkpad> Well I just need a laundry list for that. Right now, I am poking around with the core apps, to sort of get a feel for it, and add any features I think are neccessary. What do you think?\n<bzoltan_> akiva-thinkpad: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+sourcepub/5195411/+listing-archive-extra\n<akiva-thinkpad> bzoltan_: Wow awesome! Thanks for doing that!\n<bzoltan_> akiva-thinkpad:  I do not think so much :) right now .. I will check with zbenjamin next week\n<akiva-thinkpad> ha ha\n<akiva-thinkpad> enjoy your vacation\n<ahoneybun> damn DownloadManager\n<ahoneybun> akiva-thinkpad: uBeginner hit over 1300\n<akiva-thinkpad> lol nice\n<ahoneybun> yep\n<ahoneybun> I'm trying to make an app that you can download issues of a magazine\n<ahoneybun> but nothing is downloading\n<ahoneybun> plus it kinda crashes on the destop\n<robert__> Hi, I'am trying to make my emulators run, but the emulated device screen is always black, how can i figure out what went wrong during installation or creation .... ?\n<Vostro162> hey guys may anybody answer questions couple ?\n<Vostro162> ^^\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2015-07-12\n<akiva-thinkpad> !ping\n<ubot5> pong!\n<akiva-thinkpad> cool\n<akiva-thinkpad> ports no longer blocked\n<aquarius> OK, who, other than Ken, knows about the Content Hub? I can't work out for the life of me how to use it :(\n<ahayzen> aquarius, what are you trying todo with it?\n<aquarius> ahayzen, I have a list of the filenames of files in my app's data folder, and I show them in a ListView. I would like tapping a filename to show a list of apps on the phone which I can share that file to, and then choosing an app to open that file in that app.\n<ahayzen> ok\n<aquarius> ahayzen, and I cannot work out how. A ContentPeerPicker presumably has something to do with it.\n<ahayzen> yeah it will do... i've only done an import (need to still implement export for music)..but this may be useful..\n<aquarius> Also, every example I can find shows a Page with a ContentPeerPicker in it, and the app pushes that Page onto a PageStack. But my app doesn't have a PageStack, it has Tabs, so I don't know how to even show the Picker, even if I could get it working, which I can't. :)\n<ahayzen> https://code.launchpad.net/~ken-vandine/+junk/hub-exporter\n<aquarius> Yeah, I've done import; Readability appears in the browser's Share menu. It's being a source for sharing (without being a source for other apps that want to import a file) that I can't work out.\n<aquarius> Yup, I've been looking at the hub exporter code, which as far as I can tell is the nearest thing to actual documentation of this stuff, but it's pretty impenetrable :(\n<ahayzen> so what have you got working so far?\n<aquarius> nothing. The actual ContentHub code is complaining about not having peers, but Ken's hub-importer doesn't even *mention* PeerModelLoader, so I have no idea where one of those comes from\n<aquarius> I can't even get started -- I can work out so little about this stuff that I don't even know what I don't know, if you see what I mean!\n<ahayzen> he has a ContentPeerPicker {}\n<ahayzen> IIRC the way his works is to load up activeTransfer with the items to transfer\n<ahayzen> then it then picker is shown\n<ahayzen> then it calls __exportItems(url)\n<aquarius> He does, and I have one too, but when I try to use it, I get \"file:///usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/qml/Ubuntu/Content/ContentPeerPicker.qml:229: TypeError: Cannot read property 'peers' of null\"... and that code line is  \"model: customPeerModelLoader ? customPeerModelLoader.item.peers : peerModelLoader.item.peers\"... that is, it's expecting to have a PeerModelLoader or a CustomPeerModelLoader, and Ken doesn't\n<aquarius> have one, so I don't get how any of it works :)\n<ahayzen> ugh i fear i'm going to have to figure this out for music soon as well :-)\n * ahayzen wonders if that is a type \"customer\" https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/apps/qml/sdk-15.04/Ubuntu.Content.ContentPeerPicker/#customerPeerModelLoader-prop\n<ahayzen> *typo lol\n<aquarius> I have been assuming that that's meant to be \"custom\", yeah :)\n<ahayzen> it says *optional*\n<aquarius> but that is far from the worst fault in the documentation\n<aquarius> ya, I *think* that if you want to provide your own peermodelloader you can set that to override the system one\n<aquarius> but I don't seem to *have* the system one, and I don't know how to set it up, because the hub-importer never mentions it!\n<ahayzen> when you look at this page https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/apps/qml/sdk-15.04/Ubuntu.Content/ your just like which Content* thing do i want?!\n<aquarius> this stuff is totally indecipherable; the docs are either low-level API docs or high-level handwavy \"the content hub is for exchanging files between apps\" stuff. There are no explanations of *how to use it* :(\n<ahayzen> what does you code look like currently?\n<aquarius> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/11868377/\n<aquarius> but that's not useful\n<aquarius> because I'm literally just altering stuff at random ;)\n<aquarius> and clicking the listitem throws \"ContentPeerPicker.qml:229: TypeError: Cannot read property 'peers' of null\"\n<ahayzen> \"ContentType.Uknown\" https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/apps/qml/sdk-15.04/Ubuntu.Content.ContentType/\n<ahayzen> who wrote these docs ? lol\n<aquarius> is there an app which can share a file to other apps, so I can look at the source? mzanetti's Tagger does it, I think, but I don't understand that either :)\n<ahayzen> yeah camera, gallery do as well IIRC\n<mzanetti> aquarius, huh? you mean content hub?\n<ahayzen> yup\n<aquarius> mzanetti, I do\n<mzanetti> aquarius, ~mzanetti/+junk/contenthubtest\n<mzanetti> this is a test app I use when I do something with contenthub\n<aquarius> ooh, that sounds useful ;)\n<mzanetti> it can share and receive anything\n<mzanetti> not 100% finished yet\n<aquarius> thank you! I shall look at that\n<mzanetti> I plan to publish to store once it's ready... but should work fine for most parts already\n<ahayzen> aquarius, also just found this which is a text only exporter http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ken-vandine/+junk/hub-text-exporter/view/head:/Main.qml which looks quite simple compared to the others\n<aquarius> mzanetti, what's the difference between \"share\" and \"export\"?\n<ahayzen> haha\n<aquarius> that's in the content hub api, it's not a peculiarity of mzanetti's app. But nothing describes what the difference is!\n<ahayzen> i did know the difference at one point...\n<mzanetti> aquarius, export is to \"save\" a file, share is to post it to facebook etc\n<mzanetti> aquarius, depending on which one you select you'll notice different apps showing up in the ContentPeerPicker\n<ahayzen> mzanetti, how does that filter it? by the type of content?\n<mzanetti> two things. ContentType and handler (share vs export)\n<ahayzen> ah ok so by having destination: [music] .. we only appear under export IIRC ?\n<mzanetti> not necessarily... every app accepting content can specify both\n<mzanetti> you can also write an app to share music\n<ahayzen> yeah i need to make music a source of music at some point\n<ahayzen> so then you could go from the Clock and pick a track for your alarm\n<ahayzen> or your ringtone whatever\n<aquarius> since my app is basically like the file manager, I think I'd want a combination of both, but I don't know how to do that either..\n<mzanetti> aquarius, for sending things to other apps you need: the apparmor policy content_exchange_source\n<mzanetti> in your app have a \"share\" button, onClicked show a ContentPeerPicker with contentType: ContentType.All (or restrict to whatever) and handler ContentType.Share\n<mzanetti> onPeerPicked, create a new ContentItem, set the url property to your file and and set it's state to Charged\n<aquarius> ok, that makes sense; let me try that\n<mzanetti> then you can add a \"save\" or \"open with...\" button and do exactly the same, but set the picker's handler property to ContentHandler.Destination\n<mzanetti> for receiving content it's a bit different then...\n<aquarius> Simplest imaginable approach: all I want to do is show a ContentPeerPicker (I'm not even trying to do the transfer yet, so we'll screw up when a peer is picked), code at http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/11868561/ and it throws error \"ContentPeerPicker.qml:229: TypeError: Cannot read property 'peers' of null\" on startup... presumably because I don't set a PeerModel? Or something? Confused\n<mzanetti> aquarius, hmm... are you running it on the desktop?\n<aquarius> ah. I am. That may be it. I'll try it on the phone, then...\n<aquarius> same error...\n<aquarius> ContentPeerPicker10.qml:186: TypeError: Cannot read property 'peers' of null\n<aquarius> let me try your contenthubtest and work out what's different :)\n#ubuntu-app-devel 2016-07-12\n<kalikiana> Kaleo: reminder: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/readMeTests/+merge/299554\n<kalikiana> t1mp: Updated https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/windowLauncher/+merge/299119\n<kalikiana> As a side effect now having a non-working QML snippet that parses without errors exits with an error always.\n<t1mp> kalikiana: cool. happroved.\n<kalikiana> Thanks\n<davmor2> erm popey what happened to unav?\n<davmor2> popey: nevermind fresh image still had the old version on updating now will retry\n<davmor2> yeap that fixed it phew\n<pmcgowan> DanChapman, is pop3 support finished? when will it release?\n<pmcgowan> or popey?\n<DanChapman> pmcgowan: it's almost up to a releasable state.

this is not a good description; what i want to do is push uncommitted changes in my working tree to the branch i'm bound to\n<keir> use case: i suddenly have to leave while working on my laptop. i'm 80% done a feature, but it doesn't even compile at the moment. i want to push my working tree to the branch i'm bound to, without actually committing.\n<keir> this happens to me a fair amount\n<keir> what i do now, is have many commits of 'junk state'\n<keir> but i'm trying to move to a more sanitized mainline\n<mwhudson> well, there's merge --uncommitted . other-location isn't there?\n<mwhudson> ah, merge --uncommitted -d other-location .\n<keir> oh cool\n<keir> but this won't work with a bound branch; so i'd have to unbind first?\n<mwhudson> though i don't know if that'll update a working tree over sftp or whatever\n<mwhudson> hm not sure, i don't use bound branches\n<mwhudson> keir: but hang on a moment\n<mwhudson> keir: there's another answer here: don't commit to mainline\n<keir> i didn't either until recently; they are pretty handy for my laptop/desktop combo!\n<keir> mwhudson, yes, i understand that option; i still don't like it because e.g. bisect becomes much less useful\n<fullermd> A third option would be to uncommit away the dirty rev if it bothers you that much.\n<keir> but then it'd be uncomitted on my desktop when i get back, but still committed on my laptop\n<fullermd> Well, you have to 'update' on the laptop anyway, so what's the difference?\n<keir> unless i made a script commit, unbind, uncommit, ssh into desktop, uncommit\n<keir> i suppose what i'm looking for is bzr synctree\n<fullermd> No, you just update.\n<keir> if i 'update' on my laptop after uncommitting on the desktop, does that uncommit the changes on the laptop?\n<fullermd> Pretty sure I've done it more'n once.\n<fullermd> update's pretty much like pull after all; move the head to the new rev, merge any outstanding WT changes.\n<fullermd> Just because the new head isn't a descendant of the old one doesn't change anything material there.\n<Odd_Bloke> keir: You might have to 'pull --overwrite', but I don't use bound branches much so I don't know.\n<keir> interesting\n<keir> i recently turned one of the machine learning researchers here at U of Toronto onto bzr; he generally likes it\n<keir> but had some problems: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.bazaar-ng.general/33525\n<jam> ddaa, Peng: The commit after merge has been fixed for both knits and packs\n<jam> The problem was searching the global revision graph\n<jam> versus the per-file ones\n<jam> when finding common ancestor, etc.\n<keir> i didn't have a good answer to his issue, so i asked if he could post to the list, but no one has responded.\n<jam> Both are *valid*, just the global graph has more nodes to search\n<Peng> jam: Oh, cool.\n<jam> There is more work to be done (to make searching the graph faster)\n<ddaa> jam: thanks, I'll wait for my lpdev update, then :)\n<jam> ddaa: yeah, I don't recommend you converting your personal one to packs until the upstream is packs.\n<jam> Oh, and the reconcile memory consumption has also been fixed\n<jam> I'm not sure what it would be for LP now\n<ddaa> cool\n<mwhudson> is b.control_files._lock.peek()['user'] really the easiest way to find out who has locked a branch?\n<jam> but for bzr.dev it dropped quite a bit\n<ddaa> that means we'll probably switch devpad to packs shortly after the next bzr release.\n<ddaa> I appreciate how keeping memory use in control is difficult in Python\n<keir> uncommit after a commit from a bound branch is not putting the changes back into the working copy\n<ddaa> it's much easier when you can use custom allocators.\n<ddaa> that's probably the only thing I think really sucks with Python\n<jam> ddaa: well, having an algorithm that reads all inventories and buffers them in memory\n<jam> is just a poor algorithm\n<jam> It stored a slightly more efficient form\n<jam> but still had a record for every file in every version\n<ddaa> Sure, but you'd have found out earlier if you had bounded cache mechanism with a custom allocator, so you could have tested it with different memory limits.\n<ddaa> It's a recurring problem in bzr.\n<ddaa> \"If we do not cache, it's slow, if we cache it eats tons of memory.\"\n<Peng> LRUCache?\n<fullermd> Well, Ubuntu used to send out those free CD's.

Some things to consider - each item is moved log10(total commits) times.\n<lifeless> luks: its arbitrary yes, but not random :)\n<luks> well, for 100000 revisions you get only 1 pack, for 99 revision you get 18 packs\n<luks> not very good distribution, IMO\n<lifeless> at 100000 revisions, the things committed in the first commit will have been copied 5 times.\n<lifeless> luks: and you'll need to do 900000 commits to get them copied again\n<luks> well, let's say I have 999 revisions, so I have 27 packs\n<lifeless> right\n<luks> now I do a commit and all of them get repacked\n<lifeless> at that point you're paying quite a high latency price\n<luks> which means I have to reupload the whole repository\n<lifeless> so we correct that by dropping it to 1\n<lifeless> luks: with the smart server, once streaming push is implemented, you won't upload the repository again; instead the server itself will do the repack.\n<luks> I think lucene-like repacking would work better\n<luks> well, but dumb servers are a big advantage of bzr :)\n<lifeless> do you have a link for that ?\n<luks> umm, no I don't think so\n<lifeless> if you can find one I'd be delighted to read up on it.\n<luks> bit the point is that you have ~ logaritmic distribution of index sizes\n<luks> and you combine smaller indexes into bigger ones\n<lifeless> luks: so far this is exactly what we do\n<luks> but almost never touch the \"top\" indexes\n<luks> well, 27 -> 1 is not exactly that :)\n<lifeless> luks: thats precisely that. You're sampling only the times that we do touch the top indices.\n<luks> lucene would take for example the lower 5 ones and pack those\n<lifeless> luks: again, thats exactly what we do.\n<luks> nope\n<lifeless> say you have 899 revisions, with 26 packs\n<luks> it always maintains a certain number of indexes\n<luks> it will never drop to 1\n<luks> unless you manually merge them\n<lifeless> well, we could do that easily; just change the distribution logic\n<lifeless> you could do that with a plugin in fact :). The code that takes a distribution already chooses to only move around the smallest amount of revisions possible\n<lifeless> there are two problems that it has though, that seem to me to need serious consideration\n<lifeless> one is scaling\n<lifeless> if you have a really big repository its reasonable to pay more latency\n<lifeless> so a constant number of indices is really bad for small repositories (too much latency), or really bad for big repositories (too much repacking)\n<luks> the number is not constant, it depends on the whole index size in lucene\n<lifeless> ok\n<lifeless> the other thing is that if you are going to touch two indices its cheapest to just combine them together rather than in some other form\n<lifeless> this isn't quite represented correctly in the autopack.\n<lifeless> its something I realised after doing the initial code and before coming back to it.\n * lifeless files a bug\n<jelmer> lifeless: is there some way to tell the code how often to repack?\n<jelmer> lifeless: I'm thinking of mass-imports that could potentially be speeded up if the number of repacks could be reduced\n<lifeless> jelmer: well, you'll trade index latency off against repacking.\n<lifeless> jelmer: if mass imports will be improved, improve the autopack logic.\n<lifeless> jelmer: (but I do understand the desire to control this through code; I'm entirely open to a disable_autopack() api call.\n<lifeless> luks: so I've filed a bug about that. if we're going to read N packs, only ever bother writing 1 new pack.\n<lifeless> I don't know if lucene does this.\n<lifeless> but basically its silly to aim for a constant number. Because - to keep it constant, you have to shuffle data *between* your indices[packs]\n<lifeless> and as each pack is write-once.\n<lifeless> this means reading N packs and writing M packs, where N=M+1 once you hit your constant number\n<luks> well, the point is that you shuffle only the small ones or in small incremental steps\n<lifeless> (each new commit adds one pack, then you put it into your constant-sized collection)\n<lifeless> luks: but thats what we do? We only shuffle the smallest ones\n<lifeless> luks: I feel like we're talking past each other here.\n<luks> yes, but you drop the number of packs radically\n<luks> that's the only thing I don't like -- I don't want to reupload most of my repository if I really don't have to\n<lifeless> its at power of 10 intervals\n<ubotu> New bug: #172644 in bzr \"autopacking should just combine all packs it touches\" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/172644\n<lifeless> to reupload most of your repo occurs extremely rarely.\n<lifeless> and mathematically I can't see that happens any more often than lucene would do it\n<lifeless> for instance, bzr is at 15K commits now after 3ish years.\n<luks> in the terms on total used bandwidth probably not\n<lifeless> our next full-upload is going to be at 100K commits\n<luks> but in the case of lucene, it would be done in small steps\n<luks> here it's a \"all or nothing\" situation\n<lifeless> luks: then you have described lucence to be badly; because logarthimic expansion of size will behave identically\n<lifeless> at some point lucence will decide to touch a top index\n<lifeless> and make a bigger\n<luks> yes, and it would be more often than in case of bzr\n<lifeless> that bigger one will have 10 times what the previous top had in it (what whatever logN they are using)\n<luks> but the distribution of pack sizes would be different\n<luks> so you will be never in situation you have to reupload/redownload the *whole* repository\n<lifeless> I think you are wrong about the impact and frequency; rather than debating - point me at code/docs.\n<Peng> With bzr.dev working on a fresh copy of bzr.dev, \"bzr uncommit --dry-run\" uses 0.41 user seconds in dirstate, 0.86 in dirstate-tags, and 3.84 in packs.\n<lifeless> Peng: please file a bug as per my email\n<luks> can't find anything except API docs, which doesn't explaing it at all\n<Peng> I haven't seen your email, but I will.\n<lifeless> Peng: thanks!\n<lifeless> Peng: my email contains a request for a callgrind file\n<lifeless> Peng: just of the packs version\n<Peng> Just of the packs version?

That even works with --dry-run.\n<lifeless> (so if we are leaving (say) the 10K packs alone, we might choose a 'top' to spin around of a 1K pack. Then all the < 1K packs become a new ~10K pack.\n<lifeless> this of course has other problems. We currently have the situation that most data most operations want is in the smallest packs.\n<lifeless> because we strictly shuffle small->next size up.\n<jam> lifeless: don't forget that pull just creates 1 new pack of all streamed data, right?\n<lifeless> and that lets us optimise the order in which we attempt to retrieve index entries as well as providing high locality of data\n<lifeless> jam: right\n<jam> do we have 'push' doing the same thing?\n<lifeless> jam: it still tends to preserve this property.\n<luks> oh, even pull over http?\n<lifeless> luks: yes, pull over http -> one new pack.\n<lifeless> jam: yes push does the same thing\n<luks> so it autopacks everything into a single pack on the client side?\n<lifeless> luks: single *new* pack.\n<jam> luks: basically it just figures out what it will need, starts streaming the data to the pack, and then finishes once it got everything.\n<Peng> What's the pack bzr+ssh thing that corrupts the repo?\n<jam> (into a new pack)\n<lifeless> luks: then after the transaction it checks to see if it needs to autopack the whole repo.\n<lifeless> Peng: there isn't one.\n<lifeless> Peng: it was a concern that was all.\n<Peng> lifeless: Okay, right. Just an error.\n<luks> er, I actually didn't realize you can \"pick\" only some revisions from pack even over http\n<lifeless> luks: so here are the parameters: We want adjacent texts to combine into the same pack as we combine packs, so that they can be efficiently delta compressed.

Just to be clear; you have a single file that is ~40GB ?\n<Necrogami> but it has about ... 12.5Million Files attached\n<Necrogami> Yes\n<Necrogami> Xml rendered map\n<lifeless> and 12M subordinate files. wow.\n<Necrogami> It's a map for a game i'm designing\n<lifeless> so I can tell you today that we can't commit that; we hold files we're committing in memory as we commit them\n<Necrogami> 12.58 million Sq Miles each sub file is a sq mile\n<lifeless> Necrogami: ok this isn't making sense to me; if you have separate files then your main file is not going to be 44G\n<Necrogami> no ...the Sub files are Images\n<Necrogami> nothing more\n<lifeless> Necrogami: so to be sure I'm reading this right\n<lifeless> you have:\n<Necrogami> The main file contains all of the linking data for down 1 sq ft\n<lifeless> 12.58M images\n<lifeless> 1 xml file that is 44GB in size\n<Necrogami> yep\n<lifeless> bzr can't handle that today; we currently start swapping at 3M versions paths; we will be fixing that.\n<Necrogami> kk\n<lifeless> each individual file gets held in memory to commit: 1 copy for the basis, 1 copy for the current version.\n<lifeless> merges need 3 copies\n<lifeless> so you'd need about 150GB of memory to do a commit of that file.\n<Necrogami> yeah ow\n<lifeless> I'm surprised any tool can manage that size file well though, xml requires a data shuffle to modify elements\n<lifeless> so my immediate reaction is to suggest ways to shrink that file\n<Necrogami> Yeah were in the process of breaking it down to SQL of some sort\n<Necrogami> be it oracle or something\n<lifeless> now, versioning a database is still going to be a problem :)\n<Necrogami> oh i know\n<Necrogami> but breaking down the database by regions is alot easier\n<lifeless> so, we'd like to handle such size files in principle.\n<i386> wow\n<i386> big file\n<Necrogami> oh i know\n<lifeless> there are a number of engineering tasks to complete before we can.\n<Necrogami> i'll definately have to stick around...\n<lifeless> mainly writing streaming diff and merge\n<i386> Necrogami: You might have better luck breaking each \"record\" of that file into a single file\n<Necrogami> any current webapi's for bzr?\n<i386> and having an index that lists all the \"records\"\n<Necrogami> uh\n<lifeless> i386: 24M paths will be a problem too\n<Necrogami> right?\n<lifeless> i386: :)\n<i386> ahh :)\n<Necrogami> Lifeless.... Every building and item on the map is in the XML\n<lifeless> Necrogami: if you mean web viewers to see the code; yes - there is loggerhead, and bzr webserver\n<Necrogami> so record count .. is about 85 Million\n<i386> whoa\n<lifeless> Necrogami: sure thats fine; like I said, currently 3M files makes us swap on commonly available hardware\n<i386> enjoy :)\n<Necrogami> Last time i ran a record counter...\n<Necrogami> Yeah\n<lifeless> we often hold the full tree in memory; the next inventory format should take us some way to solving that and only needing to hold modified regions in memory\n<Necrogami> Nothing about this game is gonna be \"common\"\n<Necrogami> Yeah i just lost a SVN database ...\n<Necrogami> so i'm looking around for an alternative\n<i386> backups are good :\n<i386> :)\n<Necrogami> Always .. but not necessarilly easy\n<lifeless> I'm quite surprised svn managed to handle that\n<lifeless> and impressed\n<Necrogami> it wasn't handeling the main file\n<Necrogami> just all of the images and sub files\n<lifeless> oh :)\n<Necrogami> Yeah :-\\\n<Necrogami> the first time i tried to load that main file on there\n<Necrogami> it segfaulted the box\n<lifeless> rofl\n<Necrogami> so i quit there w/ that file\n<lifeless> Dinner time\n<poolie_> lifeless, i tryed changing the default and get a failure in switch tests\n<poolie_> this might be after you last tested it\n<poolie_> nm, enjoy your dinner\n<lifeless> poolie_: ring me if you want to chat aboot it\n<ubotu> New bug: #172741 in bzr \"merge from knit-repo to knit branch: invalid progress bar 0/0\" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/172741\n<mrevell> morning\n<poolie_> hi mrevell\n<poolie_> on the phone, will be off in a bit\n<mrevell> Hi poolie_\n<jdahlin> I have bzr-svn question\n<jdahlin> Is it no possible to merge from an svn repo in a normal bzr branch?\n<jdahlin> I branched of a vcs-import of a svn-repo, and then tried to merge from the real repository\n<jdahlin> which  gives me bzr: ERROR: Repository KnitRepository(...) is not compatible with repository SvnRepository(...)\n<pbor> jdahlin: I think that to be able to merge you should have branched the bzr repo with bzr-svn, branching from a vcs-import doesn't ensure that your bzr branch and the svn repo have a common ancestor\n<poolie> jdahlin, i think you might need to upgrade to a rich-root repository for the bzr side\n<jdahlin> pbor, ah, I take it that the vcs import tool is not creating branches which are compatible with bzr-svn.\n<jdahlin> poolie, hmm, how do I do that, and are you sure that would help?\n<pbor> jdahlin: yeah, that's what I've been told\n * jdahlin prays bzr-svn will survive importing his 4000 revision repository\n<nebuchadnezzar> hello\n<nebuchadnezzar> I want to make a svn branch with the bzr-svn plugin but I need to define a http_proxy\n<nebuchadnezzar> the proxy is defined for the svn command, it works but it doesn't with bzr-svn :-/\n<pbor> jdahlin: no way, you have to do that in chunks\n<jdahlin> nebuchadnezzar, did you try setting the environment variable http_proxy ?\n<nebuchadnezzar> yes\n<nebuchadnezzar> it is set\n<jdahlin> pbor, I'm 60% done, so almost there\n<pbor> jdahlin: then you have plenty of ram :)\n<jdahlin> pbor, ram usage by that process is also 60%, interestingly :-)\n<nebuchadnezzar> jdahlin: netstat show me that python send a SYN to the remote web server instead of the proxy\n<jdahlin> nebuchadnezzar, iirc urllib is supposed to pickup http_proxy\n<jdahlin> I'm not sure what bzr uses for http though\n<james_w> bzr uses pycurl by default, but this is probably going through the libsvn, so I'm not sure why it would differ to the svn client.\n<james_w> nebuchadnezzar: have you tried bzr branch svn+http://...?\n<nebuchadnezzar> james_w: it works\n<nebuchadnezzar> with svn+https:// the connection is done via the proxy\n<VSpike> hi folks.. probably a simple question but working on a train with limited battery and no internet except cellphone...\n<VSpike> i want to move versioned files from foo to foo/baz\n<VSpike> I tried bzr move foo foo/baz\n<VSpike> and it gave me a exception trace\n<VSpike> which i will email when i can as it asks\n<VSpike> so i did mkdir foo/baz\n<VSpike> mv foo/* foo/baz\n<VSpike> bzr mv foo foo/baz --after\n<VSpike> but it said foo/baz was not versioned (Id moved .bzr too)\n<Kinnison> Was this within a tree?\n<Kinnison> E.g.\n<Kinnison> mkdir foo foo/baz\n<Kinnison> bzr add foo\n<Kinnison> bzr mv foo foo/baz/\n<Kinnison> or moving a tree in its entirety?\n<VSpike> so i moved files back and tried bzr init foo/baz && bzr mv foo foo/baz\n<VSpike> i want to move tree entirely\n<VSpike> if i just move it all including .bzr it thinks files have been deleted\n<VSpike> will i have to move it sideways then down?\n<Kinnison> Erm\n<Kinnison> So you have dir foo\n<Kinnison> and dir foo is a bzr branch?\n<Kinnison> you can just rename the dir\n<VSpike> yep\n<VSpike> .bzr doesnt contain any absolute paths?\n<Zindar> no\n<Kinnison> nope, it's all relative to where the .bzr is\n<VSpike> hm ok i figured i would have to tell it somehow\n<poolie> mrevell, can you please make sure to read ian's user guide draft, if you haven't already\n<poolie> it's on the list\n<VSpike> let me try that again\n<Zindar> hi all :)\n<mrevell> poolie: Thanks for the reminder.

As the completed hook already existed, I had to add an extra parameter to avoid breaking the API and this got carried over, unnecessarily, to 'started'.\n<Peng> Odd_Bloke: Oh.\n<Peng> Hmm. Is making it non-optional worth an unannounced API break?\n<Peng> Or deprecation warning?\n<Peng> Or just an ugly workaround? :P\n<Peng> Is it possible to deprecate an argument?\n<Peng> Well, deprecate the optionalness of an arg.\n<spiv> Peng: sure\n<spiv> Peng: if the argument is not passed, do warnings.warn(..., DeprecationWarning).  There may be a fancy decorator somewhere too.\n<Peng> I don't see a fancy decorator in symbol_versioning.\n<Peng> I see an FIXME from 2006 about adding one.\n<Peng> (*January* 2006)\n<Odd_Bloke> Heh.\n<Peng> Smallville's back. BRB.\n<Peng> So, before I come back, what should I do? Deprecate it? Break API compatibility since it's minor?\n<Peng> Also, if I do deprecate it, how would I do that? I mean, what message should I use? \"location must be passed\"? And then how do I tie that into symbol_versioning?\n<jam> Peng: you *could* do something like:\n<jam> if location is None:\n<jam>   symbol_versioning.warn('As of bzr 0.93 you must pass a location to starting')\n<jelmer> jam: Do you know whether lp already uses --fixes lp:... in some way?\n<jam> jelmer: afaik it does not use it yet\n<jam> poolie: ^^ ?\n<jelmer> I don't see an open bug against launchpad-bazaar about it either >-)\n<Peng> Yet another question about my one-line code change: In NEWS, it should go under improvements, right?\n<jam> Peng: since it has a bug associated with it\n<jam> I always put it under bugfix\n<jam> it is a bit grey, though\n<Peng> There's one thing in the improvements section that does have a bug.\n<jam> so you can put it under improvements if you prefer\n<Peng> Oops. commit.py imported symbol_versioning but didn't use it at all.\n<ubotu> New bug: #172970 in bzr \"packs regression: 'bzr pull ../other'\" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/172970\n<Peng> Ooh, I just thought of something.

Now I thought it might be asier to import from subversion and yes it works, but svnbzr is so slow that after week it read only 15000 of 500000 revisions\n<jelmer> blauwal: jam has done big imports before, in particular of the mozilla cvs tree\n<jelmer> blauwal: svn2bzr of bzr-svn ?\n<blauwal> svn2bzr\n<blauwal> I've yet to try out bzr-svn\n<blauwal> because it requires subversion 1.5 bindings\n<jelmer> blauwal: is your tree available publicly?\n<blauwal> Yes\n<vila> blauwal: bzr-svn is reputedly superior to svn2bzr and there you should summon jelmer (which may too shy to say that ;-)\n<jelmer> I've never tried bzr-svn on anything > 100000 revisions, so I'd be happy to try it on your repository and fix any scalability issues\n<jelmer> blauwal: is this 500k revisions in a single branch or across multiple branches?\n<blauwal> jelmer: Multiple branches\n<blauwal> We've got some 500 libe branches and 5000 dead ones.\n<blauwal> The dead ones were already excluded\n<blauwal> The subversion repository is about 55GBytes huge\n<blauwal> s/libe/life/\n<jelmer> whoa\n<blauwal> I've written a page with detail, I'm looking it up, mom\n<blauwal> http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/SCM_Migration\n<blauwal> jelmer: svnsyncing via http is reported to be slow :)\n<blauwal> jelmer: I've got an 11 GBytes bzipped dump which I yould provide if you want to try you tool on it\n<jelmer> blauwal: I'll try bzr-svn on an individual branch first\n<jelmer> blauwal: no need to import the whole repository\n<blauwal> jelmer: great. I would suppose the .../svn/tags/OpenOffice_2_3_0 tagged version or the trunk version, they represent the current size of OpenOffice.org\n<jelmer> blauwal: thanks, I'll give that a try\n<blauwal> jelmer: I would be very interested how it works. You can reach me via hr @ openoffice.org\n<Peng> This isn't related to Bazaar, but is there some sort of etiquette when registering a branch of someone else's project on Launchpad? As long as I file bugs too, is it okay?\n<Peng> Jeepers, 1400 testbzrxxx.log files in /tmp.\n<jelmer> Peng: launchpad keeps track of both author and registrant\n<jelmer> from what I've seen, it's ok to register any branch\n<Peng> I know how Launchpad works. I was just wondering if there was general etiquette.\n<jam> was I summoned this morning?\n<jelmer> jam: yep, see ^^\n<jam> blauwal: I think we've spoken a bit before (actually on the phone)\n<jam> the thing I was waiting on was some time to hack on cvsps-import so that it could do merge commits\n<blauwal> jam: Yes. I'm doing the OOo SCM stuff\n<jam> since OOo has special tags for that\n<jam> (recording that a branch was merged)\n<jam> CVS natively doesn't support any of that\n<blauwal> jam: Yes, we are doing all sorts of nasty stuff\n<jam> unfortunately, this is getting close to bzr-1.0 release, so I've been using all my cycles for that\n<jam> I would be happy to give some pointers, etc if you want\n<blauwal> jam: moving tags, even branches, partial tags and branches etc\n<blauwal> jam: my most urgent problem is to create an import with history so we can start compare apples with apples\n<jam> jelmer: would you have any time to try an SVN conversion?\n<jam> It probably won't have the merges I wanted to add\n<jam> to cvsps-import\n<jam> but it would at least give linear histories\n<blauwal> jam: All my efforts have failed up to now :-(, cvsps bombs out, and svn2bzr (on an already migrated subversion repository is way to slow=\n<jam> blauwal: that is after the cleanup we discussed, right?\n<blauwal> jam: yes\n<jam> (your script which renames the directories, and deletes old stuff)\n<blauwal> yes\n<jam> blauwal: have you had any chance to try the cvsps patch from kenny\n<jam> (i think it was kenny)\n<blauwal> jam: I've received the patch but did not try it out. Next thing I'll do.\n<blauwal> jam: kendy (Jan)\n<jam> ah, right\n<jelmer> jam: I'll have a look at trying bzr-svn on the repository and fixing any performance issues in bzr-svn I come across\n<blauwal> jam: One other thing I noted was that doing a full local branch on a simple minded flat imported OpenOffice_2_3_0 repository (some 70000 files) is quit slow. Maybe I'm doing something wrong\n<jam> blauwal: 2 things\n<jam> a) You should be using a shared repository\n<blauwal> jam: I did\n<jam> b) you might try packs\n<jam> however, if it is time spent in build_tree\n<jam> blauwal: ok\n<blauwal> b) packs? Ok I don't know what packs are ...\n<jam> (b) bzr upgrade --pack-0.92\n<Peng> That could take a while.\n<jam> It is a different repository format\n<Peng> Heh heh, run reconcile too!\n<jam> Peng: on anything created post bzr 0.92 you don't need reconcile\n<blauwal> jam: I'll try it.\n<jam> it was pre 0.92 that had small issues about the file graph.s\n<jam> blauwal: what bzr are you using?\n<jam> (bzr --version)\n<jam> 1.0rc1 is just released\n<jam> which has some pretty big improvements for packs\n<jam> (sometimes it is hard to remember where things were at a couple months ago, since we have been actively releasing ~ every month)\n<blauwal> jam: I used 0.92. No problem upgrading to 1.0rc1\n<blauwal> jam: OK, just that I do the things right. Let's say I want to reimport OOo 2.3.0 without history. I fo\n<blauwal> I do\n<blauwal> 1) bzr init-repos --no-trees bzr\n<blauwal> 2) bzr init bzr/trunk\n<jam> (i think it is 'bzr init-repo' but yes)\n<jam> (and if you want to try packs from the start you can do \"bzr init-repo --pack-0.92\")\n<blauwal> 3) bzr checkout --lightweight bzr/trunk trunk.dev\n<blauwal> ah ok\n<blauwal> 4) add and commit all files\n<jam> but yes, that sounds correct for starting a new tree with 0 history.\n<blauwal> then, to test the time to do a local branch\n<blauwal> time bzr branch bzr/trunk my.test.branch\n<blauwal> jam: Yes. Branching took 48min even a single history revision\n<blauwal> jam: but I'll try out packs\n<jam> blauwal: what did you do for \"branching\" ?\n<jam> what was the command?\n<jam> (bzr branch bzr/trunk bzr/olderbranch) ?\n<blauwal> jam: no bzr branch bzr/trunk mybranch\n<blauwal> I also tried out checkout and checkout --lightweight, there were no big differences (no wonder since there isn't really a history in there)\n<jam> blauwal: that is branching *out* of the shared repository\n<jam> which is causing it to copy all of the history\n<jam> if you did\n<jam> bzr branch bzr/trunk bzr/mybranch\n<jam> it would have been a lot faster\n<jam> packs *do* help on the branching to a new repository\n<jam> as they have fewer files to touch\n<blauwal> jam: Yes. I know. The equivalent of \"git clone\"\n<jam> blauwal: we provide shared repositories as a way to avoid the copying you need with git clone\n<blauwal> jam: Yes, but I was trying to simulate here a developer cloning from a central server\n<jam> ko\n<jam> ok\n<blauwal> jam: not just creating a new branch inside the shared respository\n<jam> sure\n<dato> I'm writing a NEWS entry for this upload of bzr to debian; I'll give a paste line for comments, but I have one question:\n<blauwal> I did this \"git clone\" stuff on exact the same amount of data on the same machine and it took 4min instead of 48min\n<dato> in a shared repository with branches, one has to run `bzr reconcile; bzr upgrade` in the top level directory (the repository), in the branches, or in both?\n<blauwal> but, I'll redo it again with packs\n<jam> dato: just the top level, iirc\n<dato> that's what I thought\n<dato> but I read vila say otherwise in the mailing list, I think\n<dato> ah, maybe not\n<dato>     robert> To upgrade, please reconcile your repository (``bzr\n<dato>     robert> reconcile``),\n<dato> I'm pretty sure many shared repositories users will update their\n<dato> branches only. I think we should be more explicit:\n<dato>    reconcile your branches and/or your shared repositories\n<jam> hmm... I would have thought reconciling a branch in a repo would reconcile the shared repo.\n<vila> jam: it doesn't last time I did it (this week IIRC)\n<dato> so, branches inside a shared repo need a reconcile+upgrade or not?\n<Peng> Branches do need an upgrade.\n<Peng> All it upgrades is the minor metadata, but it's still something. dirstate didn't have branch.conf.\n<hsn_> who converted bzr.dev repo to packs? i cant merge\n<dato> Peng: and? can't pack repositories work with branch5 format?\n<Peng> dato: Well, they don't *need* it. But if you're already upgrading the repo, why not?\n<jam> Peng: they don't *need* an upgrade, but I would recommend it\n<jam> Branch5 works fine in a packs repository\n<jam> Branch6 just is a bit more trim\n<jam> (doesn't store the full mainline on disk)\n<dato> ok, thanks.\n<dato> comments welcome: http://dpaste.com/26320/\n<jam> hsn_: use http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev.knits\n<jam> hsn_: it should by sync'd from the other repo every hour\n<jam> vila: is it that the 'reconcile' doesn't effect the repo, or the 'bzr upgrade' ?\n<jam> I would think reconcile would always do the repo, but upgrade may not upgrade something not in the current dir\n<jam> but I realize that may or may not always be the case.\n<Peng> Yeah, upgrade won't upgrade branches.\n<vila> jam: I don't remember ;-)\n<jam> Peng: upgrade at the repository level doesn't recurse and upgrade the branches\n<jam> I was wondering about the reverse\n<jam> does upgrade in a branch\n<jam> upgrade the repository\n<jam> dato: your text sounds ok, but I'm guessing that you only need to run reconcile on the repository\n<jam> and upgrading the repository will give you packs\n<jam> upgrading the branches will give a slightly better branch format\n<dato> jam: reconcile on the repository, yes; but isn't it also needed for branches which are outside a shared repo (since they contain a repository)?\n<jam> dato: outside a shared repository, yes\n<jam> I don't know that your text made that clear\n<jam> and I wouldn't really want to force people to run \"bzr reconcile\" 200 times for each branch inside a shared repo.\n<dato> oh, you're right on that\n<dato> but I don't want to make the explanation too complex\n<Peng> jam: Oh.\n<dato> jam: hmmm. I have a knit shared repo with branch6 format branches. if I run `upgrade` in the branches, it complains:\n<dato> bzr: ERROR: The branch format Bazaar-NG meta directory, format 1 is already at the most recent format.\n<dato> is that expected?\n<jam> dato: yeah, because it is upgrading the branch, but has nothing to upgrade\n<dato> ok\n<jam> It really shouldn't be telling you the meta-dir is the latest format\n<jam> I'd be happy with a bug report on that\n<dato> what should it say?\n<jam> it should tell you that the bzrdir, and branch are the latest format\n<jam> anything it is trying to upgrade\n<jam> not just the first one\n<jam> (that way it is obvious whether it is or isn't trying to upgrade the repository)\n<dato> ok, I'll quote this in the report\n<luks> hmm, pack repo reloads all indexes every time I lock/unlock it\n<ubotu> New bug: #173061 in bzr \"possibly confusing message when upgrading an already-upgraded\tbranch\" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/173061\n<dato> jam: http://dpaste.com/26325/\n<dato> bbiab\n<jam>  but  only once in the toplevel directory for shared repositories.\n<jam> (s/the case of//)\n<jam> dato: otherwise I like it\n<jam> luks: yes\n<jam> luks: so do knits\n<jam> luks: that is what locks are for\n<luks> yep, but knits don't need locking\n<jam> telling us that you are okay seeing a snapshot\n<luks> that's what I didn't realize\n<jam> luks: they drop the cache as well\n<jam> or at least, they were supposed to\n<jam> a lock tells us that we don't have to check for changes\n<luks> I mean, knits will always have older revisions at the same place\n<luks> so if I don't lock it, I can always use an older version\n<jam> I'm pretty sure internal to the code we still dropped the index caches\n<luks> I guess I'll need to lock the repo globally in qlog\n<jam> so that we would see new items\n<jam> luks: locking it globally will see some pretty big advantages even with knits\n<luks> well, not really in a GUI application\n<luks> because I already have revision data loaded\n<luks> and those are in some state\n<luks> with knits I could always get more info even it new data were added in the meantime\n<luks> maybe it could check pack-names and if it's not modified, then keep the old indexes\n<jelmer> dato: Could you perhaps sponsor another upload of bzr-svn, 0.4.4-2?\n<jelmer> dato: -1 doesn't install the FAQ and there are some other minor changes as well\n<blauwal> jam: thanks for the tip with \"pack-0.92\", it mades all the difference. \"Outside\" branching of the trivial OOo repository is down to 5min from formerly 48 minutes\n<jam> blauwal: that is why we implemented them :)\n<jam> the old format just doesn't scale well\n<blauwal> :)\n<jam> It handles a lot of things nicely\n<jam> but we saw ways to do it better\n<dato> jam: thanks\n<dato> jelmer: ok. I guess that upload would not be compatible with 1.0~rc1, by any chance? :)\n<blauwal> jam: are there any drawbacks with the new format?\n<jelmer> dato: not yet, no\n<jam> blauwal: all current drawbacks are being addressed and most of them should be fixed in the final 1.0 release\n<jam> oh, except 'bzr annotate' being slower\n<jam> bzr commit should be faster\n<dato> jelmer: ok. is all the -2 stuff in place? (IOW can I upload already?)\n<jam> but the old commit was annotating at commit time, rather than waiting until you do 'bzr annotate'\n<jam> post 1.0 we will probably have a flag that lets projects choose which they want to do\n<blauwal> jam: I take faster commits over annotate everytime :)\n<jelmer> dato: yep\n<jam> blauwal: well, there is annotated merging which is also effected\n<jam> but that isn't the default merge algorithm anyway\n<jam> (it helps when your ancestry gets really messy)\n<jelmer> dato: do you need a binary package uploaded somewhere?\n<siretart> jelmer: aren't you a DM these days? ;)\n<dato> siretart: but he needs one last sponsored upload to set DM-Upload-Allowed :)\n<jelmer> siretart: yes, but bzr-svn doesn't have XS-DM-Upload-Allowed: set yet\n<blauwal> jam: we do lots of mass merges (CVS style), would they also be affected?\n<siretart> which is going to happen with this upload, I believe, right?\n<dato> yes\n<jelmer> siretart: yep, exactly\n<Peng> blauwal: The \"current drawbacks\" are mostly/almost all that some commands (log (at least on a file), uncommit, pull on a bundle, others) are several seconds slower, but they're not unusable, so when branching is that dramatically improved, it's definitely worth the upgrade.\n<jam> blauwal: mass-merges are generally not ancestry provoking\n<jam> it is when you have 4 branches that merge back and forth randomly betweent hem\n<jam> between them\n<jam> well, among them\n<jam> Peng: and most of that is addressable\n<jam> Peng: try with my buffer_all patch\n<jam> it helps a lot of those commands\n<jam> Peng: and it should be in 1.0rc1\n<jam> I'm currently trying to plug through the root causes of them being slow\n<jam> which will mean they end up faster than the knit form\n<jam> (the problem is generally that they use all of ancestry when they don't need to, and packs are a bit slower at all-ancestry stuff, but much faster at partial ancestry stuff)\n<Peng> jam: I know.\n<Peng> jam: I didn't mean to negate that you said they're being addressed; I was just expanding on what you said.\n<jam> Peng: I didn't know if you knew it would be in 1.0rc1, and I'm sure blauwal didn't know :)\n<jam> (And I was expanding on your expansion :)\n<blauwal> jam: ah I see. Ok our development model is rather simple. Developers branch from a milestone (trunk), work on the branch, after a while thy merge new stuff from newer milestones (trunk) into their branch. Later, the branch will be integrated back into the trunk. Problem is that these merges can affect thousands of files\n<jam> blauwal: that shouldn't be a problem for any of our merge code\n<Peng> jam: I didn't know they would all be in 1.0. That relieves me greatly.\n<blauwal> jam: I thought so, even CVS can do it with some help (manual mergetracking)\n<Peng> blauwal: A couple things were broken in 0.92 (bzr cat, bzr pushing over bzr+ssh) with packs, but they have since been fixed.\n<blauwal> Peng: great\n<Peng> blauwal: This was all a long way of saying that there were some rough edges with packs in 0.92, but they're being worked on or have already been fixed, so don't get discouraged. Also, it would be great if you reported any new issues you run across.\n<blauwal> Peng: I'll do.\n * dato giggles at `dh_perl -pbzr`; yay cdbs.\n<jam> vila: ping\n<vila> jam: Peng\n<vila> silly Xchat\n<vila> jam:  pong\n<jam> vila: just reviewing your patch\n<jam> I thought I would tease you directly about writing \"htpp\"\n<jam> you always used to write \"hhtp\"\n<jam> (my review should be on the list)\n * vila installs Ktouch and pratice instead of hacking bzr\n * vila re-type practice\n<jam> I was trying to figure out whether it was a sign of improvement\n<jam> that at least your typos are evolving\n<jam> anyway bb:tweak\n<jam> you didn't give yourself enough credit in NEWS\n<vila> about what ?\n<jam> vila: you only talk about -Dhttp and ShortReadv\n<jam> but you also fixed the code when issuing too many range requests\n<jam> (well, to at least only issue 200 at a time maximum)\n<vila> Ha yes, as I said in my email ?\n<vila> regarding the typos, the progress is making them in the comments instead of the code ;)\n<fullermd> blauwal: As far as the CVS conversion, there was a cvs2svn guy in here a month or two ago soliciting for somebody to write a bzr output backend for it, who said it probably wouldn't be too much work.\n<fullermd> That may be an avenue to explore.\n<blauwal> fullermd: yes. Actually cvs2svn does a lot of the heavy lifting - make sense out of not so consistent CVS archives\n<blauwal> fullermd: actually, the last version of cvs2svn that worked for me is 1.5.1. They did something to 2.0.1 which makes it as slow as molasses, I need to talk with him anyway :)\n<fullermd> Yeah.  So with a little work on a backend to write into bzr, we get to stea^Wborrow all that work  ;)\n<blauwal> fullermd: yeah. I will look into it, but, unfortuantely I'm more of a perl than python expert and don't know anything about bzr to boot (though way too much about CVS) so I don't know if anything will come out of it.\n<fullermd> Oh, I wasn't suggesting locking you in the basement until you came out with it done   ;)\n<jam> blauwal: I think fullermd was suggesting locking *me* in a basement.\n<blauwal> jam: :)\n<fullermd> Just that it's alleged to be a fairly simple thing (couple days work for someone familiar), so it may get done by someone else in the coming months.\n<fullermd> jam: Of course not.  That would be unhumane.\n<fullermd> That's what attics are for...\n<jam> fortunately, my basement has escape windows\n<jam> hmm... my attic doesn't\n<Peng> jam: Fall through the ceiling.\n<jam> messy, and still an 8-foot fall, but I suppose better than trying to break through a wall and falling 30 ft\n<Peng> You could try to kick a hole in the ceiling and drop down.\n<fullermd> No, no, you gotta crawl through the duct work.  It's more dramatic that way.\n<fullermd> And you get to hum the M:I theme while you're doing it.  What more could a man want?\n<vila> blauwal: still being more a perl expert than a python myself, I'd say just try it, you are in for some good surprises\n<fullermd> Pshaw.  Python doesn't even have $>, how good can it be?\n<blauwal> vila: Yes, python has come a long way. I've only dabbled with it so far.\n<jam> fullermd: don't you mean: $Pshaw. @Python $doesn't $even $have $>, @how $good @can ~/it/be\n<blauwal> but even after working with perl for > 10 years, perl is still good for some surprises, too ...\n<vila> TIMTOWTDI often becomes this is the way to do it, but getting rid of $@% and replacing '->{}' with '.'  is quite a relief\n<fullermd> %{@not[$much]}, obviously.\n<jam> vila: you mean that you can do it 10 different ways, but only 1 is good?\n<vila> jam: no, I mean python promote a good way where perl leave decide which one you prefer\n<blauwal> vila: I agrre TIMOWTDI is no really a strength but a weakness of perl\n<blauwal> s/agrre/agree/\n<jam> s/no/not/\n<fullermd> Ack!  vila's spelling is already infecting you!\n<jam> :)\n<jam> It is all about the UDP connection from brain to hands\n * vila cries seeing fullermd spoling its own joke while trying to fix his typos...\n<jam> there really should be some checksums in there\n<vila> 44\n<jam> not that I'd want to pay the speed of an ACK round trip for each character\n<fullermd> My problem, OTOH, isn't data corruption; it's mixing multiplexed streams.  Hands multitask poorly   :|\n<jam> fullermd: I beg to differ. *A* hand multitasks poorly. *hands* can do a decent job :)\n<vila> blauwal: I don't think it's a weakness, it makes reading others code harder since nobody agree on how to do things, but it also gives more freedom\n<fullermd> Yeah, you'd THINK that, until the first time you accidentally chew your stomach and pat your gum while walking...\n<blauwal> vila: I admit I love to code perl because of this freedom, but I usually don't love what other guys make out of my carefully crafted perl code :)\n<vila> blauwal: hehe\n<vila> python execptions is a good example, you *can* throw and catch exceptions in perl (die, if ($@)) but since there is no agreement on how to do that, there are rarely used\n<jam> $@ ????\n<jam> ouch\n<jam> I guess it makes your perl start to look more like math notation\n<jam> since everything is in symbols\n<blauwal> vila: yes. Actually I use die; if ($@) all the time, but no here seems to understand it\n<vila> jam: see, you talk perl ! $@ contains the reason of your 'ouch' ;-)\n<blauwal> jam: It's actually a very nice regular syntax\n<jam> blauwal: true, but it takes a while to learn the difference between $_ $> $@ @foo $foo $<\n<jam> and implicit operators\n<jam> ~/foo/\n<jam> chomp\n<fullermd> I do tend to use the names rather than the symbols for all but the handful that I use most often.\n<vila> use English is your friend\n<jam> I could see that once you get used to them, maybe you can parse more symbols per second than\n<jam> you could english words\n<jam> but until then, it is completely opaque\n<blauwal> jam: yes. Now one can code in perl very productive but I bet this also holds for python and maybe ruby, too\n<jam> blauwal: I think python has less implicit stuff in it.\n<fullermd> Well, in ruby, you don't have to be productive; running the code is so slow it doesn't matter if writing was fast  ;>\n<jam> So you have to learn less of the language to understand what someone else wrote\n<jam> (certainly one of the main design comments is :Explicit is better than implicit.)\n<blauwal> jam: Actually the biggest obstacle in perl is to learn how to create complex data strcutures.\n<jam> I found perl's argument handling to be.... iffy\n<blauwal> jam: Everything else (objects etc) comes easy later\n<jam> That may have gotten better\n<jam> since I used it\n<fullermd> Yeah.  That's the big thing that kills me in perl, since I don't use it enough anymore to remember   :|\n<fullermd> Function args are a close #2.\n<fullermd> Supposely, though, both are much better in perl 6, so that should be a nice switch to make in, like, 2025 or so.\n<jam> python's ability to name the arguments at call time is really nice\n<jam> foo(bar=X, baz=Y)\n<vila> blauwal: fully agree, but once you understand than perl references are C pointers and fight perl tendency to make sense of every bogus expression, you define *far* less types than in python\n<jam> often makes it very clear at the call site what you are trying to do\n<jam> vila: well, and perl is happy to auto-cast your variables\n<jam> '1' + '2' == 3\n<vila> jam: you can name perl arguments, just a hash as an arg\n<fullermd> Oh, that's not the big problem with function args; it's that they're a list, not args, so trying to pass, say, two @arrays requires some hoop-jumping (normally they'll just turn into one large @)\n<blauwal> vila: yes.\n<vila> jam: I'm been bitten more often by python '%d' % '12' -> '12' is not an int than by perl\n<jam> vila: but then can you pass them as positions?\n<blauwal> fullermd: Thats what references are for\n<jam> vila: always use '%s'\n<jam> vila: it works for *all* types\n<jam> But I'm guessing you are doing that because you are *coming from* perl\n * fullermd is reminded of Jim Fulton's monkeys/snake quote.\n<vila> jam: yup, and I realized that '%s' was the way in my problematic cases\n<blauwal> My biggest complain about perl is that classes are more or less bolted on and look strange\n<vila> coming from perl one the most annoying one is '' is the same as \"\"\n<vila> funny one ;-)\n<fullermd> blauwal: Well, yeah, but that's the hoop jumping.  Kinda annoying.\n<vila> fullermd: always use references and you're done\n<blauwal> I've written a CVS client library in perl, which is nicely object oriented and looks strange for most\n<vila> @$array is your friend ;-)\n<jam> vila: well, I imagine having perl inline expand is nice when you want it\n<jam> \"$foo\" versus \"%(foo)s\" % vars()\n<fullermd> Yes, but you have to use the \\ everywhere you call the function then.\n<fullermd> Luckily, I don't hold with OOP, so any weakness perl has there bothers me not at all   ;)\n<vila> fullermd: no you *declare* them as references $array = []\n<vila> instead of @array = ()\n<fullermd> Ugh.  Trading one problem for another...\n<fullermd> I'll just keep on working in PHP all day, where it works rationally.\n<jam> vila: you point out something, though @$array versus $@ exception object\n<vila> fullermd: TIMTOWTDI ;-)\n<vila> jam: no $@ is a special variable ;-) @$ dereferences an array reference\n<blauwal> fullermd: It's quite funny, but all these $,@,% come quite easily after you get used to it. Well, and you have understood the difference between evaluating them in scalar or list context\n<vila> %$ dereference a hash\n<jam> vila: sure, but $@ means something *very* different from @$\n<Peng> vila: That line should be quoted.\n<jam> and I don't think the @ symbol in \"$@\" has any similar meaning to the \"@\" in @$\n<jam> sort of like if I named my variables\n<Peng> FWIW, http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BzrVsHg\n<jam> foo, fOo, Foo\n<jam> foo = 10\n<jam> Foo = object()\n<vila> jam: $@ (Mnemonic: Where was the syntax error \"at\"?)\n<jam> def fOo()\n<fullermd> Yah, but I don't do perl nearly enough to remember all the rules for different contexts and passing and making references in a deep array for easier code writing and yada yada.  So it's always a fight.\n<jam> if fOo(foo) == Foo:\n<jam>   Foo.foobar()\n<jam> Would be hard to read\n<fullermd> I understand the intent behind \"things that _are_ different should _look_ different\", but my life is easier when you just reference variables all the same.\n<vila> fullermd: yup, that's the blocking point, I had problems overcoming that and I've seen many block there.\n<jam> die if($@ == @$bar)\n<fullermd> Whether it's a $scalar or a $numeric[$array] or an $associative['array'].\n<vila> jam: true, I don't like the separate namespaces for scalars, arrays, hash and so on\n<fullermd> Or $however['deep'][$one][$may]['go'].  Lot simpler.\n<fullermd> And sometimes in perl you have to $do{'this'}, except for when you have to $do->{'this'}, and the latter often works even when not necessary, except...\n<fullermd> There _is_ rhyme and reason behind it, but if you don't do it every day, it seeps out of your head _real_ quick and leaves you crying.\n<vila> fullermd: my main trick is: $scalar $carS $handler_OF (caps for emphasis) works very well for perl, not for python\n<vila> fullermd: that's why always using references simplifies you only use $do->{this} (stop the silly quote, keys don't need them except if they contain spaces or such) the same trick in  python is to do dict(car='2cv', house='small') instead of {'car': '2cv', 'house': 'small'}\n<vila> but $->{} for perl when '.' for python.... far less typos ;-)\n<fullermd> Oh, I always use the quotes.  It looks better to me.  Bare words are keywords, not data strings  ;)\n<vila> fullermd: argh, {'car': '2cv', 'house': 'small'} killed me until poolie showed me the dict() trick\n<jelmer> dato: anything else I should do for the bzr-svn upload?\n<dato> jelmer: no, I'll do it later today\n<jelmer> dato: cool, thanks :-)\n<blauwal> I've got to go for today, but I certainly will come back to this channel and pester^H^H^H^H^H ask you for more infos regarding bazaar and Openoffice. Thanks!\n<dato> jelmer: do you know if bzr1.0 has been branched off, or bzr.dev is still only open for 1.0 stuff? I thought the latter was the case, but I saw bialix talking about opening a new entry in NEWS.\n<vila> blauwal: thanks for OpenOffice ;-)\n<fullermd> dato: I'm pretty sure I've seen an extant 1.0 branch discussed...\n<Peng> Another Launchpad behavior question: Is it worth registering a branch for like a small thing that probably won't be changed and is fine as a bundle?\n<dato> vila: is the \"dict trick\" dict(a='b', c='d'), or something else?\n<Peng> Worth mentioning is that due to my locations.conf setup, bundles include a source_branch location, so I do create a public branch location anyway.\n<Peng> dato: That's it.\n<jam> fullermd, dato: 1.0rc1 has been released\n<jam> but it has been done so with an expectation that we will likely see 1.0rc2\n<jam> Peng: depends on your definition of \"worth it\"\n<jam> I do it all the time\n<jam>  (I think having branches associated with bugs is a nice thing)\n * Peng giggles and runs off to Launchpad.\n<dato> jam: yes (I already uploaded it to debian ;); my question was whether development of 1.0rc2 would take place in bzr.dev, or in a separate branch.\n<jam> especially if someone ever wants to backport a fix, etc.\n<jam> dato: you would have to ask poolie\n<jam> I'm guessing bzr.dev\n<dato> jam: that's what I thought; I was asking because bialix was talking about opening NEWS a new.\n<Peng> I mostly feel like I'm imposing, jumping into a fairly inactive project with 3 or 4 bug reports and half a dozen branches.\n<jam> Peng: well, that is what distributed control is all about\n<jam> it lets someone take over the inactive stuff\n<jam> in a friendlier way than a fork\n<jam> And LP helps too, since it gives you a place to announce your stuff\n<jam> near where people. might be accessing the original stuff\n<jam> (without LP a branch on your on host would probably never be seen)\n<jam> Peng: what projecT?\n<jam> project\n<Peng> And now that I can be seen, I'm really wanting to set up HTTPS. Hmph.\n<Peng> jam: pytz.\n<jam> Peng: well it seems like it may not be officially hosted on LP\n<jam> just that stub uses LP + bzr to track upstream\n<jam> hmm, take that back\n<jam> as stub is the developer\n<dato> haha\n<jam> dato: We should start a new section at the top\n<jam> even if it is going to be 1.0rc2\n<jam> if you look at older NEWS records\n<jam> you can see that we break down the changes by each public release\n<jam> sorry I didn't think about it earlier.\n<dato> bah, you're right :)\n<chiefinnovator> Why is bazaar not working?  The first command on the tutortial breaks.  $ bzr whoami \"John Doe <john.doe@gmail.com>\"\n<luks> how does it break?\n<chiefinnovator> I get: bzr: ERROR: extra argument to command whoami: John Doe <john.doe@gmail.com>\n<luks> um, what version of bzr?\n<chiefinnovator> 0.8.2\n<fullermd> Whoah.\n<chiefinnovator> It sucks being on Dapper.  Everything is old\n<jam> chiefinnovator: http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/debs/dapper\n<luks> wget http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.92.tar.gz && tar -zxvf bzr-0.92.tar.gz && cd bzr-0.92 && python setup.py install :)\n<chiefinnovator> I just did aptitude install bzr\n<luks> oh, there are debs for dapper...\n<jam> chiefinnovator: http://bazaar-vcs.org/DistroDownloads\n<jam> chiefinnovator: we have a repository for dapper versions\n<jam> I don't think it has the latest latest\n<chiefinnovator> ah I see\n<jam> but it has stuff a lot newer than 0.8\n<chiefinnovator> So the default did .8 though\n<chiefinnovator> You couldn't identify yourself in .8 :-)\n<luks> you can edit ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf\n<jam> chiefinnovator: well if you want to use 0.8, you can go to the 0.8 tutorial\n<jam> http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr-0.8/tutorial.html\n<fullermd> Did email even exist back when 0.8 was current?   ;>\n<chiefinnovator> I'll go ahead and get the new one\n<chiefinnovator> So this is better than Mercurial right?  I was trying to decide all morning\n<jam> we think so :)\n<fullermd> Obviously, this is the place to come for an unbiased answer to that question...\n<chiefinnovator> isn't\n<jam> chiefinnovator: http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrVsHg\n<chiefinnovator> Biased is ok, just want to reinforce my decision :-)\n<chiefinnovator> Yeah, I read that one\n<fullermd> Of course, I've long subscribed to the belief that it doesn't matter if I'm biased, as long as I'm right   ;)\n<chiefinnovator> sounds good\n<jam> fullermd: a completely true statement, it is just that the former influences the perception of the latter\n<chiefinnovator> well I go ahead and update then, thanks for the help\n<Peng> chiefinnovator: The problem is, they're both better!\n<chiefinnovator> true, coming from SVN\n<fullermd> It would do us well to explain once why hg's hardlinking is not a capable alternative to shared repos, instead of having to fumble it up every time it comes up.\n<Peng> Hg's hardlinking also has its benefits, mainly that you can clone to anywhere on the filesystem, not just inside the shared repo.\n<fullermd> Well as long as you're using a fs that supports hardlinks.  And cloning on one fs (though I don't know if shared repos can span fsen; branches can't)\n<jam> Peng: though packs will also support hardlinking without having to ever break the links\n<jam> fullermd: shared repos can span fs\n<jam> you just have to have a containing fs\n<jam> so if you put one it /\n<jam> all your branches would share across all filesystems\n<jam> we do expect that .bzr/* is on the same filesystem as all working files\n<jam> so that we can do atomic \"os.rename()\"\n<fullermd> (mind you, I have a very low opinion of any fs that _doesn't_ support hardlinks.  But they are out there.)\n<jam> fullermd: and there are those like HPFS+ that *do* but very poorly\n<jam> (as in, performance is better without hardlinking)\n<fullermd> Mm.  Packs may support hardlinking without strictly speaking having to break, but they still have all the same side effects as breaking.\n<jam> fullermd: the problem with knits is that you have to probe and see if you need to break\n<jam> before writing to them\n<jam> (same thing for revlog)\n<jam> which means it isn't safe to do over sftp\n<jam> etc\n<jam> but it *is* safe to use packs in a similar fashion\n<jam> over sftp when the remote one is hardlinkde\n<jam> hardlinked\n<fullermd> Safety isn't my argument against it.  It's that it's not shared; your branches only share storage as long as you don't touch either one.\n<fullermd> Soon's you start commiting in one or the other, you progressively work back toward 2*space.\n<jam> fullermd: completely true\n<jam> and packs have the side effect that changing 1 file 10,000 times\n<jam> will get you back to 2x space\n<jam> because it breaks the link for \"unrelated\" files\n<fullermd> So saying \"We don't need shared repos, hardlinks do just as well\" is false, even if it's done completely safely.\n<jam> (though if one file is changing 10,000 times, you probably don't have that much in common anyway)\n<jam> fullermd: I agree (I certainly never made that assertion, I like shared repos) but that doesn't mean it is incompatible with also doing hardlinks\n<jam> probably our bigger impedance to hardlinking packs\n<fullermd> Oh, I'm arguing against the statement I've heard from hg before (and is on their reponse page against our BzrVsHg)\n<jam> is that we garbage collect when you push/pull/branch\n<jam> fullermd: do you have that page? I'd be interested in reading it\n<fullermd> 11:17 <Peng> FWIW, http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BzrVsHg\n<Peng> If I had a wiki account, I might add a comparison of shared repo vs. hardlinks.\n<jam> Peng: if you want to write it up in ReST format\n<jam> I'll upload it for you\n<Peng> I meant to the hg wiki. :P\n<Peng> And it would only be one paragraph.\n<kiko> wow, what a nasty page.\n<james_w> wow, you guys have been busy.\n<Peng> They're always busy.\n<james_w> true, *especially* busy.\n<jam>  james_w who is \"you guys\"? the chat channel?\n<james_w> jam: no, everyone flooding my bzr mailbox :)\n<kiko> hey I've been busy too!\n<james_w> all the merge requests, bug triaging :)\n<james_w> kiko: I don't doubt it, feel free to bounce me copies of all your work so that I can marvel at that as well :)\n<kiko> I deal in psychological counseling and disaster management. I wouldn't bounce those to you.\n<kiko> you seem like a nice person.\n<james_w> ah, thanks kiko.\n<kiko> however if you have a crisis, you can call me!\n<jam> james_w: well that is just a targeted strike to make you unproductive by DOS'ing your email server\n<lifeless> jam: hi\n<jam> hi lifeless\n<jam> good morning\n<jam> you are actually showing up at a reasonable time\n<jam> I'm so proud of you\n<lifeless> well I have guests\n<lifeless> been doing stuff round the house :)\n<lifeless> given it's my sat, I'm not sure showing up is reasonable :)\n<lifeless> anyhow, I thought I'd ask if there was anything you needed help with; I have somewhat under 2 hours that I can do 'stuff' in if needed.\n<jam> lifeless: I have 3 patches up for review\n<Peng> Make packs more awesome!\n<jam> one is the \"fetch checks basis\"\n<jam> patch\n<jam> Which depends on your reconcile stuff\n<jam> so get your reconcile merged (if it isn't yet)\n<jam> and then review mine\n<jam> 2 and 3 are performance patches\n<jam> that get rid of some of our poor scaling\n<lifeless> I was going to let your branch merge both\n<jam> lifeless: sure, if you want to approve it... though I did want the comments, etc from you\n<lifeless> right; I'll review now\n<lifeless> abentley: whats my password again ? :)\n<lifeless> I'm not on my normal machine\n<lifeless> Peng: we will make them more awesome\n<Peng> :D\n<lifeless> abentley: nvm, got it\n<lifeless> jam: reviewed one\n<fullermd> Peng: You need bzr init --format=pack-moreawesomeer\"\n<Peng> If only improving software were as easy as adding a \"--moreawesomer\" argument...\n<lifeless> jam: okies, reviews done\n<lifeless> jam: bbiab\n<lifeless> jam: ping\n<jam> lifeless: pong\n<lifeless> so\n<lifeless> I will be going in < 1 hour\n<lifeless> if you need more discussion or review we should do is asap\n<lifeless> *i*\n<lifeless> *it*\n<jam> Nothing that cannot wait the weekend, IMO\n<lifeless> ok\n<lifeless> I have only mon and tuesday next week\n<Peng> lifeless: Changing the delta algorithm will halve disk usage?\n<lifeless> Peng: yes\n<Peng> lifeless: From what to what?\n<jam> k, I only have a couple more hours, and you've given me enough for that\n<jam> lifeless: to xdelta from line-deltas\n<jam> and changing the compression order\n<jam> Peng: ^^\n<lifeless> Peng: well e.g. 50 to 25M thereabouts, for bzr.dev\n<jam> just changing the order brings the biggest benefit\n<lifeless> jam: something you might find interesting when you get say 2 hours 'spare'.\n<jam> ?\n<lifeless> jam: put your inventory reweave into 'bzr pack'\n<lifeless> jam: that is, subclass Packer to one that regenerates the inventory deltas to be optimal.\n<jam> oh, to change the # of inventory fulltexts\n<lifeless> jam: or at least analyse and decide if it's optimal/blind reinsert. That sort of thing. yes.\n<jam> Peng: there is an interesting property when it comes to deltas and merges\n<jam> in that the delta against left parent when merging\n<jam> is the sum of the chain of commits\n<jam> which means it is usually rather large\n<jam> multiparent diffs help\n<jam> but that means you have to unpack both sides\n<beuno> oook, after two days of using packs, it seems all in all considerably faster then knits. I have ~140 branches at the office spread around the filesystem, is there some clean/automatic way of upgrading all of em to packs?\n<dato> find/locate + script, probably\n<jam> beuno: \"for branch in `bzr branches`; do bzr upgrade $branch; done\"\n<jam> (if you have bzrtools for 'bzr branches')\n<lifeless> beuno: find .bzr/repository/revisions.knit - dirname twice; reconcile; upgrade\n<jam> which will be a lot slower than \"find . -path '.bzr/branch'\"\n<dato> jam: (s/path/wholename/, I think, in case you'd be interested)\n<jam> beuno: I would recommend lifeless's solution but dirname 3 times\n<lifeless> jam: does your reweave inventory do anything strange?\n<beuno> we might want to have a nice downloadable script handy once 1.0 hits the stores\n<jam> lifeless: I believe it just inserts inventories into the target using the new algorithm\n<lifeless> jam: or is it just get_graph_with_ghosts + topo_sort + reinsert ?\n<jam> for version in knit.versions(): knit.add_lines(...)\n<lifeless> hmm, I might whip this up\n<jam> it has been a while, though\n<lifeless> another thing that would be niftt\n<lifeless> nifty\n<lifeless> have bzr info -vv\n<lifeless> show how much space each fileid consumes\n<lifeless> - sum the record sizes for everything with that id\n<lifeless> spiv: in case you haven't figured it out; index is self.stream_index compares object instances, (self.stream_index is a _StreamIndex). So its safe, its a string when its a thunk request - that is not self.stream_index.\n<jam> lifeless: another way it could be rewritten... compute what should be a delta and what should be a fulltext. If the current index matches, just copy the data across. only if it misses do we need to do add_lines()\n<jam> it would make it a lot faster\n<lifeless> jam: yah\n<lifeless> jam: same as reconcile's stuff for texts\n<jam> yep\n<lifeless> jam: its what I meant by 09:12 < lifeless> jam: or at least analyse and decide if it's optimal/blind reinsert. That sort of thing. yes.\n<lifeless> jam: another possibility is to consider only the fulltexts\n<jam> lifeless: also, I think if you favored doing a fulltext at a merge revision\n<jam> since those would tend to be larger anyway\n<beuno> hey Verterok\n<jam> It seems we don't have any branch_implementation tests that pull(other) will raised DivergedBranches\n<jam> we have 1 blackbox test that happens to exercise it\n<jam> weird\n<jam> (it turns out my pull_set_last_revision stuff broke it, but not branch tests failed)\n<Peng> I have a plugin (bzrtools) installed with bzr 0.92 in my system. But now I'm running bzr.dev. How should I hook up the plugin into it?\n<jam> Peng: I always install it in ~/.bazaar/plugins/bzrtools\n<jam> directly from Aaron's branch\n<jam> because he has to usually update it for each bazaar release anyway\n<jam> so I can just \"cd ~/.bazaar/plugins/bzrtools; bzr up\"\n<Peng> Ahh.\n<Peng> You run non-release bzrtools too?\n<Peng> Oh, duh.\n<Peng> If I'm using non-release bzr, I need non-release bzrtools too. Hmm.\n<jam> not always, but usually\n<jam> aaron is pretty good about not really breaking stuff\n<jam> actually, I've been spoiled by bzr, such that I feel like running tip of lots of projects\n<jam> only to find out they aren't as careful\n<Peng> Heh.\n<Peng> Run Mozilla from CVS!\n<jam> well, CVS by its very nature will tend to create broken stuff if you do anything but get tags :)\n<jam> and even then\n<jam> ...\n<jam> oh, I'm wrong, the pqm has just been changed to stop on the first error... shame, I always used the pqm to give me the list of tests I needed to fix :(\n<Peng> Modern computers are fun. I just did a find through my entire home directory to find all of the .bzr dirs, and run upgrade on them, and it took like 30 seconds.\n<Peng> (I had manually gotten all of the repos, but not all of the branches.)\n<Peng> There were 45 of them.\n * lifeless waves\n<lifeless> oh Peng - are you using bzr again now ?\n<Peng> Only 28 .hg dirs. :P\n<lifeless> Peng: if so, cool, and welcome back to the fold :)\n<Peng> lifeless: Not for that main thing. But I never stopped using it for other things.\n<lifeless> Peng: oh, cool.\n<Peng> (The main thing being where I could stress-test it best. Hmph.)\n<lifeless> Peng: please let us know where we fail w.r.t. that main thing at the moment.\n<Peng> lifeless: I have no idea.\n<lifeless> :)\n<Peng> But even if I wanted to go through the hassle of another conversion, then I would barely be using hg, and I don't want that.\n<lifeless> Peng: well, :)\n<lifeless> ok, gone for real.\n<Peng> lifeless: I'd be happy to do any tests you want me to on a copy of the bzr branch from before the conversion. It's about the same, just a bit smaller.\n<Peng> (Don't really feel like doing it right now, though. Also, Firefox is busy hurting the system's responsiveness.)\n<Peng> (A fun way to measure what Firefox is doing is to time my usual large commit that I do frequently. When Firefox is closed, it's 16 seconds user time and a couple seconds sys and wall-clock time is normal, but when Firefox is really hogging things, wall-clock is always above 50 seconds, rarely above a minute.)\n<fullermd> You can't run Mozilla from CVS.  The compile time is longer than their release cycle...\n<Peng> Heh.\n<Peng> You can always be out-of-date *and* unstable.\n<fullermd> No, I don't have a Windows CD.\n<Peng> Mozilla has an hg branch, which is just a direct copy of almost all of the CVS tree. Last I heard, it couldn't compile without CVS. Hmph.\n<Peng> Off-topic, but since everyone here is smart and GPG-signs everything, what do you do about backing up your PGP key? I'd store encrypted backups, but there has to be an unencrypted version somewhere to be able to decrypt the backup of it! Do you put it on a floppy at Grandpa's? Encode it in the Bible and hide it in multiple safes in booby-trapped locations on each continent? Upload it to a hidden directory on your shared web space and hop\n<Peng> e no script kiddies hack your blog?\n<Peng> Ooh, multiple lines. Nice.\n<fullermd> Tattoo it on the inside of your eyelid.\n<Peng> What if I get a new one with a longer algorithm? :(\n<kiko-afk> so somebody tie jam up\n<kiko-afk> jam, do you have all this code in a DVD somewhere and you are slowly unleashing it to the world?\n<fullermd> Write smaller.\n<Peng> Seriously, though.\n * fullermd shrugs.\n<fullermd> I'm not an especially heavy user.\n<fullermd> I follow the methodology of \"put all your eggs in one armor-plated basket, and watch it like a hawk\"\n<Peng> What's that mean?\n<fullermd> It's the opposite of avoiding putting all your eggs in one basket, because spreading them securely and reliably isn't as easy as a lot of people think.\n<Peng> Hmmph.\n<abentley> jam: are you planning on doing xdelta packs?\n<Peng> I believe Mercurial has had problems with how xdelta scales.\n<Peng> What about IBM's algorithm? http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/hsadelta\n<abentley> Well, I'd rather use the MPDiff format we already use in bundles.\n<abentley> But the main thing is, I don't want to duplicate effort with jam.\n<schierbeck> jelmer: ping\n<jelmer> schierbeck: pong\n<schierbeck> jelmer, does the bzr-gtk trunk still reside in ~bzr/bzr-gtk/trunk?\n<schierbeck> even when we have a ~bzr-gtk team?\n#bzr 2007-12-01\n<jelmer> schierbeck: yes, though I can try to change that\n<schierbeck> that would be great -- i have a one-line patch that fixes a crasher in the mainline version of the viz\n<schierbeck> i'm not sure if it needs to go through the review process -- even if it doesn't, i'm not able to push\n<jelmer> schierbeck: ok, it's now at ~bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk/trunk\n<schierbeck> wow, that was fast\n<schierbeck> do you think i should push the revision?\n<schierbeck> it's just removing an import of a now nonexisting file\n<jelmer> yeah, sounds good to push without review\n<jelmer> so now the main branch is at ~bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk/trunk you could start pushing your own approved revs :-)\n<schierbeck> nice :)\n<Peng> What order are the sections (\"BUG FIXES\", \"IMPROVEMENTS\", etc.) in NEWS in?\n<Odd_Bloke> Peng: I'd suggest looking at NEWS to find out. :p\n<GuyIncognito> Newbie question:  I'm working on a project with the \"Decentralized with shared mainline\" workflow.  I want to \"fork\" the project into two different development efforts.  I guess this would be \"making a new revision\"?  But what is going to happen when people start pushing their changes back to the mainline from the two different branches?  Is there a best practises for this, or am I going about it the wrong way?\n<GuyIncognito> * sorry I meant to say \"This would be 'making a new branch'?\"\n<Odd_Bloke> GuyIncognito: What you would do is 'branch' the shared mainline into a separate branch.  You would then 'merge' changes from that branch back into the mainline.\n<GuyIncognito> Old_Bloke:  OK.  What happens if several people want to work on the new branch?\n<Peng> Odd_Bloke: Seems to be arbitrary.\n<fullermd> GuyIncognito: You can have multiple shared branches, instead of just one.  Just set up the second similar to the first.\n<Odd_Bloke> GuyIncognito: Well, any given branch can be treated as centralised.  That is to say you could branch 'mainline' to 'feature-1' and then have people use 'feature-1' using any of the listed workflows.\n * Peng adds a reference to the bzr branch to the trivial bug he's been working on. :O\n<Peng> I feel kinda bad about polluting the big important list of branches with something trivial.\n<Peng> But it also has taken a few commits and continued to be modified, at least a little.\n<GuyIncognito> fullermd, Odd_Bloke:  Thanks!\n<Odd_Bloke> GuyIncognito: No worries. :)\n<JordanC> Hyello\n<JordanC> Does anyone else have problems with Launchpad & olive?\n<JordanC> I try to grab from there or push and I get \"unexpected response\"\n<abentley> The location for bzr-gtk has just moved to ~bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk/trunk\n<JordanC> ?\n<abentley> ?\n<JordanC> Were you talking to me?\n<abentley> Yes.  I thought that might be relevant to you.\n<JordanC> Hmm\n<JordanC> Still wondering why no SVN on launchpad :P\n<abentley> Still wondering why no SVN on list of \"once-popular products that no one's using\"\n<JordanC> ...no-one's using SVN?\n<abentley> No one should be.\n<JordanC> (I know of at least 30 off the top of my head)\n<JordanC> Well, i've had nothing but problems with bazaar -_-\n<abentley> I'm sorry to hear that.\n<fullermd> It probably saw svn installed on the system and got huffy.\n<abentley> So what protocol are you using to retrieve bzr-gtk?\n<JordanC> I'm trying to use olive at the mo\n<abentley> Same source tree.\n<JordanC> Can i get bzr-gtk via yum\n<abentley> No idea.  The Bazaar project has debs, but I don't think any rpms.\n<JordanC> Yeah, I have it\n<JordanC> But there's no GUI\n<JordanC> It's just tools\n<JordanC> And I'm using KDE :P\n<JordanC> bzr-gtk is a plugin for Bazaar that aims to provide GTK+ interfaces to most Bazaar operations.\n<fullermd> Can probably do a quick grep through yum list (or is it yum search?

I think it'd be useful for it to be available by default.\n<dato> I'm also revamping the description.\n<siretart> great, thanks\n<dato> jam, vila: I would also like to know whether you think python-pycurl should still be pulled by default when installing bzr (in Debian, and possibly in ubuntu), or it's better to leave it out now.\n<dato> siretart: do you have any idea why on earth we Suggest: libxml2-utils?\n<siretart> dato: no idea. maybe lifeless knows?\n<dato> maybe. the changelog is not helping.\n<james_w> /usr/bin/xmllint, /usr/bin/xmlcatalog\n<james_w> I'm not sure what either of those would be for.\n<james_w> hi all btw.\n<dato> hi james_w\n<dato> oh, no jelmer\n<dato> siretart: http://dpaste.com/26427/\n<james_w> dato: conclicts\n<james_w> \"yet able to adapt to many workflows, reliable, and easily extendable.\" is a little uncomfortable, I would suggest dropping the \"yet\".\n<dato> james_w, thanks, fixed (both).\n<james_w> dato: it's good, thanks for doing it.\n<vila> \"no special software the server is needed\" ? \"no special software is needed on the server\"\n<dato> the intention was \"no special software *in* the server is needed\"\n<vila> regarding pycurl, there are two http implementations in bzr: one based on pycurl, the other on urllib\n<dato> yes\n<vila> if pycrul is the default if present\n<dato> yeah, I know.\n<vila> the major difference is that pycurl verifies ssl certificates\n<dato> the question was, whether to make installing bzr in a system also pull pycurl in\n<dato> iow, what do you feel that would be a better default: pycurl available or not\n<james_w> dato: I would think available.\n<vila> dato: I'm a bit biased since I rewrote most of the urllib ;)\n<james_w> also looking again I think vila's \"no special software is needed on the server\" is better.\n<dato> ok, done\n<vila> frankly I don't know if pycurl should be pulled or not. When people want certificate verification pycurl is mandatory (today), if they don't want certificate verification pycurl should be avoided (by forcing the use of  urllib)\n<james_w> of course the best solution would be to get vila enough spare time to add certificate validation to urllib.\n<dato> vila: avoided?\n<vila> james_w: ;-)\n<james_w> yeah, pycurl wont let you access a site with a self-signed certificate for instance, so you have to force urllib to access it.\n<vila> dato: no hhtps connection can be issued if certificate verification fails (included self-signed certificates)\n<vila> and also if your installation is screwed or the site use an unknown CA\n<vila> since urllib makes no verification... it's usable. *And* I will provide the necessary hooks to allow urllib to cope with the situations above\n<dato> so, maybe not pull pycurl, and leave a note in README.Debian on when it could be useful?\n<dato> maybe downgrade it to suggests\n<dato> ah, I meant to mention in the description what paramiko is useful for\n<vila> you stop doing that ?\n<vila> put it back and add an equivalent section for pycurl maybe ?\n<dato> stop doing what? there was never any place in the debian packagin explaining what was paramiko needed for\n<vila> s/if your installation is screwed/& regarding the certificates/\n<vila> I heard at least two reports (or three) where the ca-certificates package were not installed even when pycurl was (or liburl, or curl, whatever ;)\n<vila> s/liburl/libcurl/\n<vila> err, waitaminute, james_w, *you* had a case where ca-certificates not installed no >\n<vila> s/>/?/\n<james_w> vila: yeah, I've tried to see why, but I'm couldn't see it.\n<vila> dato: sry, misunderstood you, I thought you said you *was* doing, I think it will be a good idead to do so.\n<vila> james_w: I think I sent you an email afterwards with some hints (after looking a bit myself)\n<vila> Subject: ca-certificates as a bzr dependency\n<vila> To: James Westby <jw+debian@jameswestby.net>\n<vila> Date: Wed, 21 Nov 2007 12:01:48 +0100\n<james_w> vila: yeah, thanks.\n<vila> AAARGH silly posting addresses here :-(\n<vila> so sorry :(\n<dato> is paramiko needed to push over bzr+ssh?\n<james_w> vila: no problem, there are plenty of other places to harvest it.\n<james_w> and the '+' is a good anti-spam device anyway.\n<vila> really ?

Now that I'm using bzr.dev, I don't want to bother installing 1.0rc1.\n<abentley> Yeah, I'm chronic that way.\n<abentley> I did have to revert to 1.0rc1 temporarily, to make sure bzrtools 1.0.0 works with it.\n<abentley> Which you can do with \"bzr revert -r branch:http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.1.0/\"\n<Peng> What the hell is wrong with Firefox?

But since my account was shuffled around, I've stopped getting new IPs anyway.\n<Peng> (The one time it's gone down since it was shuffled, anyway.)\n<Nafallo> well, your PPPoE can disco without line-sync go down, and your computer is only aware of connectivity to the modem.\n<Nafallo> as far as freenode go, you never reached the TCP timeout.\n<Peng> Not PPPoE anymore. \"ENET ENCAP\".\n<Peng> My hostname changed from saying \"dyn\" to \"dhcp\" and now I get crappier IPs.\n<Nafallo> nice :-)\n<Peng> I got a new modem too, because apparently mine should've burned out years ago.

Slightly higher sys than with hg, I think. :P\n<Peng> lifeless: Now, it's gotten larger since this old copy was made, so it would be slower (no idea how much), but if bzr was this fast in August, I never would've switched to hg.\n * Peng wanders off.

The problem with me is also that the files I'm committing keep getting larger, so even if history doesn't slow it down, the diffs will.\n * Peng wanders off.\n<dato> jelmer: btw, you were the second approver of my small patch to NEWS, maybe you could merge it? http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/request/<20071129185051.GA12330%40chistera.yi.org>\n<abentley> lifeless: ping\n#bzr 2007-12-02\n<lifeless> abentley: pon\n<abentley> So I started hacking on per-file base selection yesterday, and I found a locality-of-reference problem.\n<lifeless> ok\n<abentley> The file content is stored in the versionedfile.  The file type is stored in the inventory.\n<abentley> So to do it absolutely correctly, I'd have to retrieve all the trees for the selected revisions.\n<abentley> Because the selected revision may not be a file-- it may be a directory, symlink or tree reference.\n<lifeless> ok\n<lifeless> I see\n<lifeless> now, if the kind is the same on both tips\n<lifeless> does that make it easier ?\n<abentley> In fact, we're already assuming it's a file on both tips.  Otherwise, we wouldn't need a base at all.\n<lifeless> so if its the same on both tips\n<lifeless> 3-way merge says that if the base is a different kind\n<lifeless>  -> we'd treat is as empty of the same kind ?\n<abentley> Not quite.  We'd still emit foo.BASE in the correct kind.  But wrt the file merge, yes.\n<lifeless> now symlinks and dirs have an existing empty text for their revisions\n<abentley> AFAIK, correct.\n<abentley> So we can shortcut the kind check 99% of the time.\n<lifeless> so; and I realise this is hacky;\n<lifeless> if doing a 3-way custom base on two currently-file-texts, w.get_lines(custom_base) will give us [] when the kind has changed.\n<abentley> I hate to have it shortcutted 99% of the time, though.  It makes me fear the full path won't get adequately tested.\n<lifeless> are you doing custom bases for symlinks and dirs too?\n<abentley> No.  Those will get handled by the standard merger, which also handles inventory issues such as renames and executability.\n<abentley> I don't think those things change enough to require the same care as text files.\n<lifeless> so I guess I'm saying; if we're only doing custom base on (text, text) pairs; and get_lines(custom_base) will always return a suitable set of lines, ([] when the common base has a different kind), then its not a shutcut situation\n<abentley> By shortcut, I mean that we're avoiding retrieving the file kind from the relevant inventory.\n<abentley> But in the case where it's [], we will have to do so.\n<lifeless> I don't see that we ever need the file kind for the base if the parents are both texts; other than to write foo.BASE.\n<abentley> Right.  But we will have to write foo.BASE.\n<lifeless> ok\n<lifeless> so lets look at that\n<lifeless> we write foo.BASE when we ended up doing a merge right\n<abentley> Right.\n<lifeless> now, will we avoid doing 'merges' sometimes with custom file bases ?\n<abentley> No, but if the BASE is not a file, we will do a two-way merge between THIS and OTHER.\n<lifeless> which is where [] is useful because it's just a clean degradde.\n<abentley> A clean what?\n<lifeless> degrade\n<lifeless> it's what 3-way degrades too\n<abentley> Okay.\n<lifeless> hmm, one sec local interrupt\n<lifeless> back\n<lifeless> wondering if we will ever get base == left or base == right with custom merge bases\n<lifeless> I think we can\n<lifeless> consider this\n<lifeless> at the graph level we have two lca's\n<lifeless> so we recurse\n<lifeless> its easy then for at the file level for one side to be purely an extension of the other for a single file\n<lifeless> so when we are considering that single file we'll not need to merge at all\n<lifeless> I'm going to think out lout now\n<lifeless> and enumerate what I think the possible cases are\n<lifeless> * Base is one side (common I suspect in criss-cross merges; many files won't be actually unmerges)\n<lifeless> * Base is the revision the graph level base had\n<lifeless> * Base is another inventory\n<lifeless> s/another inventory/from &/\n<lifeless> done\n<lifeless> abentley: ^\n<josep17> buenas noches\n<josep17> desde venezuela\n<abentley> lifeless: I would expect base==left or base==right to be rare.  But I would imagine we can get it.  I'm not sure why it matters.\n<abentley> We need a general solution.\n<abentley> Sure, I can hack up something gross to do per-file bases, but I think you ought to consider how an upcoming repo format could give us cheap access to file kind, symlink target, and maybe execute bit.\n<abentley> Right now, I'm re-implementing annotate merge, and it's going swimmingly.\n<jelmer> dato: resubmitting bzr-svn fixed it\n<jelmer> dato: your upload of 0.4.4-2 hadn't been processed yet, apparently\n<abentley> jelmer: Have you noticed that the bzr-gtk test suite is completely borked if run as part of the bazaar test suite?\n<lifeless> abentley: I'm pretty sure I hit it all the time.\n<lifeless> abentley: anyhow, our current format can give use kind/target/execute quite cheaply\n<lifeless> abentley: just use the same parse-a-delta-fragment logic.\n<abentley> Oy.  Can't we do up a format where that works by design instead of being a tremendous hack?\n<lifeless> abentley: yes, both the ones poolie and I have been fiddling/mailing about will work by design\n<abentley> Awesome.\n<lifeless> abentley: but they largely formalise useful properties we have been able to leverage from the current format.\n<lifeless> abentley: I have been thinking that content object information should be pushed down to the per file graph anyhow; as metadata on the node\n<abentley> Well, I know the new format will do comparisons much faster, but that sounds like it would slow them down.\n<lifeless> abentley: I'm thinking some duplication actually\n<lifeless> abentley: but also there is locality of data possibilities.\n<lifeless> abentley: this would be a 2nd or 3rd iteration out.\n<lifeless> abentley: one possibility is:\n<abentley> Oh, by \"pushing down\", I thought you'd be taking it out of the inventory.\n<lifeless> kind + exec + content in the 'knit'\n<lifeless> inventory has parent + name + pointer to the knit version\n<lifeless> 'knit' index can pull kind + exec into it.\n<lifeless> abentley: the open things in my mind about whether this makes sense are what datum we actually need at the same time\n<abentley> For our tree-manipulation functions, we generally use inventory and file texts simultaneously.\n<abentley> When building a tree, to create a file, we need file_id, name, parent, kind, execute bit, and content basically simultaneously.\n<abentley> That's not a hard requirement.  TreeTransform could work efficiently if you learned names, parents and file-ids in one pass, and everything else in a second pass.\n<lifeless> abentley: so its the case of status/diff when the last-mod is different and the value is the same that would be hurt\n<lifeless> abentley: -> how common is that\n<lifeless> (assuming we don't want false positives for st\n<lifeless> another possibility here though is to decouple the metadata graph from the content graph\n<abentley> This is assuming we're not diffing against a DirstateRevisionTree?\n<lifeless> right\n<abentley> So we wouldn't have the md5sum in the inventory?\n<lifeless> so you'd have (fileid, parentid, name, content-pointer[revid, validator]) as a graph\n<lifeless> and (kind, exec, content) as a graph\n<abentley> I'm not sure at all how common that is.  Merges can produce it, though.\n<lifeless> you'd have a sha1, but not of the lines, of the lines & kind and exec bit\n<lifeless> this would for instance, allow us to start only storing one copy of 'COPYING' etc, depending on how we want to take it.\n<lifeless> this is all still wildly speculative\n<abentley> I don't think kind is a big concern.  If it changes, we definitely need to get all the data.\n<abentley> I dunno, though.  I think having all the data in the inventory might well be a win.\n<lifeless> I'd like to be in a position to experiment\n<abentley> Just because there are many operations that just want to know which files changed.\n<lifeless> write some arbitrary benchmarks outside bzr that simulate access patterns and the like\n<lifeless> maybe this is something we can reason about in march\n<abentley> Also, some stats on real trees might help us answer these questions about what's common better.\n<lifeless> abentley: indeed. So having an analyser that can report what a transformed tree would look like would be good\n<abentley> I'm not sure what you have in mind.  The PreviewTree thing?\n<lifeless> nah\n<lifeless> just a script to take a branch\n<lifeless> and break it out into the things I'm talking about, without doing disk transformations, just in-memory, and report\n<abentley> Oh, to simulate a changed repo format?\n<lifeless> right\n<jelmer> lifeless: what breaks about it?\n<jelmer> s/lifeless/abentley/\n<jelmer> ah, I see\n<lifeless> meh\n<lifeless> sorry about disappearing; what did I not respond to\n<Odd_Bloke> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<Odd_Bloke> 05:03:21 -!- lifeless [n=robertc@ppp245-86.static.internode.on.net] has quit [Read error: 113 (No route to host)]\n<Odd_Bloke> 05:15:45 -!- lifeless [n=robertc@ppp245-86.static.internode.on.net] has joined #bzr\n<Odd_Bloke> Oops, got the trackbar.\n<Odd_Bloke> But yeah, nothing. :p\n<lifeless> thanks\n<alecwh> hello, I'm considering using bazaar for a project of mine... we're using subversion right now, because subversion is offered on Google Code, and Gna! (http://gna.org). Are there any free repository hosts that our GPL program can use (using bazaar)?\n<beuno> alecwh, sure, https://launchpad.net/\n<beuno> it also works as a bug tracker\n<beuno> (and a bunch of other stuff)\n<alecwh> no way... it hosts a free bazaar repository? that's awesome.\n<alecwh> how do I set it up?\n<alecwh> https://code.launchpad.net/phpns/\n<alecwh> This is our project\n<alecwh> Register branch?\n<beuno> alecwh, let me fetch you a how-to real quick\n<Peng> Hmm. I just started using LP a bit. I should look into the launchpad plugin.\n<beuno> alecwh, https://help.launchpad.net/FeatureHighlights/BazaarHosting might help a bit\n<beuno> but you basically just push to the right address with bzr\n<beuno> and the branch gets created\n<beuno> the folks at #launchpad might be able to give you more details though\n<beuno> it's a bit over 5am here, so I'm going to bed\n<beuno> good luck  :D\n<alecwh> ok, thanks a lot bueno. ;_\n<alecwh> ;)\n<Peng> Might be even simpler using lp: URIs.\n<Peng> New Pyrex release.\n<alecwh> How do I import a subversion repository into a bazaar repository?\n<Peng> alecwh: You could use bzr-svn.\n<alecwh> what does that do?\n<Peng> alecwh: bzr-svn can even allow pushing from bzr to svn. It's pretty neat.\n<Peng> alecwh: Well, for one thing, it imports svn repos into bzr repos.\n<alecwh> yeah, that's what I'm looking for. =D\n<alecwh> how does that look like?\n<alecwh> the bash command.\n<Peng> Not sure.\n<Peng> \"bzr branch\" might do it.\n<Peng> Read the docs.\n<alecwh> ok, thanks Peng. =)\n<lifeless> alecwh: www.bazaar-vcs.org/svn IIRC\n<alecwh> This page does not exist yet. You can create a new empty page, or use one of the page templates.\n<alecwh> lifeless: I got that error.\n<lifeless> alecwh: there is a link on it\n<lifeless> alecwh: to BzrSvn :)\n<alecwh> ok, thanks lifeless. I'll read over it.\n<JordanC> Hey there\n<JordanC> Tried to get things working with olive, but no dice/\n<alecwh> hey JordanC. =D\n<Odd_Bloke> JordanC: Define 'no dice'. :p\n<alecwh> Odd_Bloke: It didn't work.\n<Odd_Bloke> Yeah, I got that much. :p  I was hoping for something a little for specific. :D\n<Odd_Bloke> s/for/more/\n<JordanC> I came in here a while back, and yeah\n<Odd_Bloke> JordanC: Are you using Olive or bzr-gtk?\n<JordanC> I spoke to some developers, and they said that because of the SSH factor, I can't connect to launchpad using olive\n<Odd_Bloke> Ah, OK.\n<Odd_Bloke> Have you looked at QBzr?\n<JordanC> Hmm, lesee\n<JordanC> KDE Bazaar proggy?\n<Odd_Bloke> JordanC: http://bazaar-vcs.org/QBzr\n<luks> no, in two ways\n<Odd_Bloke> Qt, not KDE.\n<luks> not a program, not kde\n<JordanC> Damnit\n<ronny> yo\n<ronny> is there a way to get more easy to parse output from bzr ?\n<ronny> (im parsing the status output for an ide, an its really tricky to get it together atm)\n<Odd_Bloke> ronny: There's an xmloutput plugin, I believe.\n<Odd_Bloke> ronny: https://edge.launchpad.net/bzr-xmloutput\n<Odd_Bloke> ronny: Which IDE were you thinking of?\n<abentley> luks: I'm looking at your patch more carefully now.\n<luks> thanks :)\n<abentley> I think a nicer way to extract the name would be to have a pattern that only matches if there's \"name <email>\", and if it fails to match, just return the original string.\n<ronny> Odd_Bloke: pida\n<luks> well, I think returning \"email\" from short_author is better than \"<email>\"\n<luks> unless you want to match \"(name )?<email>\", which is exactly what the patch does\n<abentley> I think that's highly unlikely.\n<ronny> Odd_Bloke: right now we parse the command output, cause the subsystem for python-api based vcs tools is basically nonexistant\n<luks> abentley, \"<email>\" is the use case from the bug report\n<ronny> the bad thig is - we get wrong data sometimes, but cant figure the exact source, cause the bzr output aint nice to parse (so the parser is tricky)\n<abentley> Also, I don't know if lazy_regex was meant to be used in new code.\n<abentley> I thought it was just to make existing code faster.\n<abentley> And I really doubt there's a performance win by using it.\n<luks> but what's the point of compiling a regular expession you are not going to use\n<luks> sure, it's not a big win, but there is a lot of small things like this\n<abentley> There's no win, there's loss in compiling a regular expresion.  I was talking about not compiling at all.\n<luks> hm? you mean parsing the string manually?\n<abentley> no, just using re.match\n<luks> that compiles it every time you use it\n<abentley> Right.\n<luks> so about 3k times for log on bzr\n<ronny> actually its cached\n<abentley> luks: I really doubt that performance difference is observable.\n<ronny> the more often a re is used, the more sense it makes just to compile it\n<ronny> but the difference is only small, cause all re's u use are cached in re._cache\n<luks> abentley, I mean, bzrlib already has code to delay regex compilation, pre-compiled regex is faster than re.match, there is a patch that use it -- why make is slower? even if the difference is small\n<abentley> Because it's clearer to just write re.match\n<abentley> Takes fewer lines.  Doesn't require people to grok lazy_regex.\n<ronny> hmm - how does lazy_regex work ?\n<luks> compiles the regex when it's first used\n<luks> *first time\n<ronny> im more intrested how the store works\n<ronny> cause i doubt it has any notable gain compared to re.match\n<abentley> ronny: It allows the \"lazy_compiled\" patterns to be substituted for really compiled patterns-- that's what it's for.\n<abentley> So you can fix import slowness without rewriting the module.\n<ronny> \"import slowness\" ?\n<abentley> regexes that compile at import time reduce cause latency problems for programs like Bazaar.\n<abentley> You run bzr, it imports a whole bunch of modules, they compile a whole bunch of regexes, and then, finally, it starts doing what you asked.\n<ronny> hmm - why do you guys need so many regexes ?\n<abentley> The libraries we import need them.\n<abentley> (well, they *have* them.  *need* is debatable)\n<ronny> btw - any timeframe when bzr will be as fast as hg ?\n<abentley> For example ConfigObj has regexes that produce a noticeable compile delay.\n<abentley> ronny: It depends what you're talking about.  With the packs format, commit speed is pretty similar.  With the smart server, pull time is similar.\n<abentley> status has been comparable for some time now.\n<ronny> ah - so its mostly cause bzr has tonns of other operation modes ?\n<abentley> Well, it depends what operation you want to speed up.\n<ronny> all i care for is fast sync and fast commit\n<abentley> I think 1.0 will give you that.\n<ronny> hmm - i didnt exactly use bzr for quite some time\n<ronny> does it still try hide the existence of multiple heads (for example by allways enforcing merges)\n<abentley> I think we've got the pieces in place to support good performance for most commands.\n<abentley> I don't know what you mean by hiding the existence of multiple heads.\n<abentley> But in some cases, the commands must be updated to take advantage of them.\n<ronny> last time i used it it dodnt allowme to hae multiple heads in my repo\n<abentley> Repositories typically have many heads due to people uncommitting revisions.\n<abentley> But we don't have multiple heads for a single branch.  Instead we allow multiple branches per repository.\n<ronny> hmmk - thats a problem for me\n<abentley> Why?\n<ronny> enforces me to split one semantical branch into multiple branches if more than one person is working on that\n<abentley> No, they can use heavyweight checkouts.\n<Odd_Bloke> ronny: That's what you're doing with multiple heads anyways...\n<abentley> That lets them commit locally.\n<abentley> And then sync up with the main branch when they're ready.\n<ronny> damn - how many modes of operation does bzr have ????\n<abentley> We support a range from svn-like to fully distributed.\n<ronny> hmm - having too many choices tends to be confusing\n<abentley> Well, we have three: a \"tree\" has a branch and working copy at the same location.  A \"heavyweight checkout\" has a branch in one location and the working copy is at different location, but has a local copy of the branch to act as cache.  A lightweight checkout is like a heavyweight checkout with no local cache.\n<alecwh> I just created a bazaar branch at launchpad (https://code.launchpad.net/~alecwh/phpns/devel), and now I want to upload my project (which is in /var/www/devel) to the repository. In the terminal, my working directory is /var/www/devel, and I gave the command:  bzr push bzr+ssh://alecwh@bazaar.launchpad.net/~alecwh/phpns/devel , but it doesn't seem to be working. I get the error: bzr: ERROR: Not a branch: /var/www/devel/ , can anyone help me upload\n<luks> cd /var/www/devel; bzr init; bzr add; (check if it added only files you want); bzr commit\n<luks> and then you can use bzr push\n<luks> http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr.0.92/en/mini-tutorial/index.html#putting-files-under-version-control\n<alecwh> ok, I'll try that. will 'bzr add' add every single directory and file inside /var/www/devel?\n<lifeless> moin\n<alecwh> moin?\n<lifeless> alecwh: yes, add adds recursively, obeying your ignore rules\n<alecwh> thanks lifeless. I've got one more question: when I was using svn, every 'commit' you made actually uploaded your changes to the online repository. Is this not the case with bazaar?\n<lifeless> alecwh: if you have a checkout it acts like svn\n<alecwh> a checkout?\n<lifeless> alecwh: that is, if you do 'bzr checkout bzr+ssh://alecwh@bazaar.launchpad.net/~alecwh/phpns/devel local-dir-name'\n<lifeless> then you can cd local-dir-name, and do\n<alecwh> that will download the project, right?\n<lifeless> 'bzr commit', which will commit back to bzr+ssh://alecwh@bazaar.launchpad.net/~alecwh/phpns/devel, just like svn\n<alecwh> oh.\n<beuno> alecwh, or, when you want to send all your commits, just use \"bzr push\"\n<lifeless> alecwh: if you have a separate 'branch' though, then your commits are performed just on your machine\n<alecwh> ok, that makes sense.\n<alecwh> https://code.launchpad.net/~alecwh/phpns/devel\n<beuno> (when using branches instead of checkouts)\n<alecwh> I just finished uploading everything...\n<lifeless> alecwh: and then when you want them to be in bzr+ssh://alecwh@bazaar.launchpad.net/~alecwh/phpns/devel, you do 'bzr push bzr+ssh://alecwh@bazaar.launchpad.net/~alecwh/phpns/devel' (bzr will remember the push location the first time, so you don't need to type it every time0\n<alecwh> how do I make it so every time I 'commit' it will update this repository?\n<lifeless> alecwh: bzr bind bzr+ssh://alecwh@bazaar.launchpad.net/~alecwh/phpns/devel\n<alecwh> ok lifeless, that worked. =D\n<alecwh> I was using 'cia.vc', which puts a bot inside your channel on freenode, and then it will post a message inside the channel whenever a commit/change is made. Is there something like this for bazaar?\n<lifeless> alecwh: there is a plugin for bzr to announce to cia\n<lifeless> alecwh: you can also subscribe to the branches on launchpad\n<lifeless> alecwh: or install bzr-email to send emails to arbitrary email address's on commits\n<alecwh> ok, cool. Do you know what the plugin was called? I'm just looking for it...\n<lifeless> http://www.google.com/search?q=bzr+cia&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a\n<lifeless> 3rd and 4th hits look relevant to me\n<alecwh> https://launchpad.net/bzr-cia\n<alecwh> lifeless, uhm, how do I get the plugin? =P\n<beuno> alecwh, with bzr, of course  :D\n<alecwh> https://code.launchpad.net/~jelmer/bzr-cia/main\n<alecwh> is this the one I'm looking for?\n<beuno> alecwh, yeap\n<alecwh> bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~jelmer/bzr-cia/main?\n<alecwh> use that command?\n<beuno> alecwh, yeah, you download it with that command\n<alecwh> ok, done. =D\n<alecwh> I think I got it now\n<beuno> now, follow the instructions in: https://launchpad.net/bzr-cia\n<lifeless> success; we have a 1.0 build on dapper-amd64\n<lifeless> i386 testing now\n<lifeless> brb foodstuff time\n<dato> jelmer: very well\n<dato> jelmer: btw, I guess there is no way to convert from svn a trunk and a branch, if I somehow say which revisions from the trunk are merges from the branch, right?\n<jelmer> dato: only if you can go back in history and set some magic svn properties\n<dato> jelmer: can I a dump of the repository, load it locally, set the properties there, and redump? that ought to work?\n<jelmer> dato: yes, but you would want to change the uuid\n<dato> ok. is there a document explaining what properties I should set?\n<jelmer> and pulling from the original in the future may be problematic\n<jelmer> http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrForeignBranches/Subversion/mapping\n<jelmer> basically, you'd want to set the bzr:ancestry:vX-SCHEME property\n<lifeless> dato: is it really worth doing? why not just do a merge after the conversion?\n<dato> jelmer: it's a one-time conversion\n<dato> lifeless: I seem to find a strange pleasure fiddling with the tools.\n<lifeless> dato: :)\n<dato> jelmer: ok, thanks for the link. I'll try to do it. also, I svn-import trunk didn't work for me yesterday, but the packaged version worked fine. I'll try again tomorrow. finally ;), changing the UUID is just a matter of editing the dumpfile by hand, or?\n<jelmer> dato: the trunk branch for bzr-svn is highly experimental\n<jelmer> dato: 0.4 is the branch that is packaged\n<jelmer> dato: yep, editing the dumpfile should be all that's needed to change the uuid\n<abentley> lifeless: What do you consider a good way to decide if something should be a separate module or not?\n<abentley> I was expecting plan_merge to be bigger than it is, which is why I originally did it.\n<lifeless> abentley: I don't have a good rule; sometimes I get there and combine; sometimes I start in the same module and split.\n<vila> wtf ? test_revision.TestIsAncestor.test_is_ancestor is failing just under the comment:\n<vila>         # NB: if you see an assertion error here, its probably access against\n<vila>         # an unlocked repo. Naughty.\n<abentley> I guess by analogy, I'd think if merge3 has its own module, then annotate merge can have one, too.\n<vila> the problem is I'm working on http response parsing rewrite and I can't find any link >-/\n<vila> Worse, the same test on bzr.dev@3059 fails too, midnight bug ?\n<vila> and on top of that, I see (when doing bzr missing in my bzr.dev branch) revno: 3061, deprecate bzrlib.revision.is_ancestor\n<vila> Ran 9939 tests in 437.020s\n<vila> FAILED (failures=1, known_failure_count=5)\n<vila> bah, time to sleep anyway, a bit frustrating though\n<vila> not failing anymore in bzr.dev@3065... at least....\n<lifeless> jelmer: where is bzr-gtk for 1.0 ?\n<lifeless> abentley: oh it can have one if you think it should; I was asking the question.\n<abentley> Sure, and I've actually decided to move them into versionedfile and merge.\n<abentley> Just because there's so much related stuff in those modules.\n<jelmer> lifeless: phanatic is doing release management these days, I'll ping him by email\n#bzr 2008-11-24\n<pygi> jelmer, duck branches :p\n<pygi> good work btw\n<jelmer> hi pygi :-)\n<jelmer> Thanks :-)\n<jelmer> pygi: Duck branches ? What does the duck refer to?\n<pygi> jelmer, It can swim on water, and it can walk on ground. Users who don't use the plugin see only one branch, and  others can see the whole thing :P\n<pygi> bzr duck create\n<pygi> bzr duck remove\n<pygi> bzr duck [branch] (switches to branch)\n<pygi> bzr duck (lists branches)\n<pygi> so obviously, argument to create and remove is [branch] too :)\n<pygi> o, and bzr duck [branch] asks you if you want to create branch if it doesn't exist\n<jelmer> pygi: :-) I like the name\n<pygi> jelmer, good, so you'll take it? :p\n<pygi> we need to make this bzr thingy more fun, perhaps more people will use it then :D\n<pygi> I'm having a hard time convincing O'Reilly that it's worth to do a book on bzr :(\n<jelmer> pygi: yeah, I think so\n<jelmer> pygi: :-(\n<jelmer> what bit is the problem? Are the other books on VCS not doing well?\n<pygi> jelmer, actually, they only want to do book on most popular DVCS :/\n<pygi> and that is Git ...\n<pygi> Andy said that if I can show him that every version of bzr gets downloaded 80000 times per version, he might be able to convince his bosses...\n<pygi> but I can't do that, so :P\n<pygi> (some other publishers are interested tho ... but O'Reilly is O'Reilly)\n<jelmer> Did you look at ubuntu popcon?\n<pygi> yup ...\n<pygi> 20745 downloads of bzr\n<pygi> 41440 downloads of git-core\n<pygi> that's 1:2 ratio\n<pygi> at debian, ratio is 1:6 ...\n<jelmer> a 1:2 ratio isn't that bad, if the downloads are apparently high enough for O'Reilly\n<jelmer> *downloads for git\n<pygi> I think they have the source tarball download number for git ...\n<pygi> not sure\n<pygi> but yes, they're doing git book\n<jelmer> There's more publishers than O'Reilly out there though...\n<pygi> yup, I know\n<pygi> already got offer from one, waiting on others\n<jelmer> we were pretty happy with PH when we published the Samba HOWTO\n<pygi> I don't have any contacts with PH ...\n<pygi> So far we've got offer from Packt Publishing, and I think we have good chances with Manning\n<pygi> Pragmatic said they'll contact us in two weeks\n<pygi> jelmer, if you know someone in PH ... :)\n<jelmer> I can check, but I don't think I do anymore\n<jelmer> my only contact (our editor) has switched jobs since the book was first published\n<pygi> aha, don't worry then ;)\n<james_w> nice work jelmer\n<chandler1> so bzr is claiming to be unable to load the paramiko module.

Anyone know how to pre-cache my passphrase using gpg-agent or something?\n<awilkins> jelmer: I've had some trouble getting the 0.5 branch of bzr-svn to work ; first, the minor change of having to replace the substitute header file includes. After it compiled though, I am getting errors\n<awilkins> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/76319/\n<awilkins> It does mystify me slightly why the plugin is doing anything at all when doing `bzr version`\n<Peng_> If your bzr install exists in a branch, \"bzr version\" will open it up so it can display the basic details. bzr-svn is involved while it's probing to see which format the branch uses.\n<awilkins> Peng_: It's not a branch\n<awilkins> Neither is the plugin\n<awilkins> But that would seem to be the source of the problem\n<awilkins> Meh, it seems to be fetching data from a public SVN repo just fine. Trust me to pick the one command that makes it go \"bang\"\n<awilkins> Aha, not the only command that makes it go \"bang\" then\n<awilkins> Same error from a \"branch\"\n<awilkins> It manages to grab the revision metadata\n<pygi> jelmer, poke\n<matkor> Hi ! How can I get information from bzr update which file exactly it gets \"bzr: ERROR: [Errno 13] Permission denied\" ?\n<awilkins> Patching the source to report it in the traceback or you could use Sysinternals filemon (you seem to be on Windows)\n<awilkins> matkor: Vista or XP?\n<matkor> linux :)\n<hmeland> If it is a local file, strace can help you.\n<hmeland> E.g. \"strace -e trace=file -o strace.log bzr update\" and have a look towards the end of strace.log when that finishes.\n<hmeland> There might be a more-to-the-point solution within bzr, though; the strace log will be quite verbose.\n<VSpike> Sod's law says which ever machine I have IRC open on, it will be the wrong one\n<VSpike> Must install an IRC proxy sometime\n<VSpike> Anyways, using bzr shelve in cygwin w/ 1.8 I get \"bzr: ERROR: Failed removing shelved changes from theworking (sic) tree!\"\n<VSpike> Any ideas?  Google did not help me much\n<VSpike> http://pastebin.com/m234d816b\n<VSpike> I wonder what bzr command it's trying to execute at that point?\n<pygi> VSpike, do you have diffutils  installed?\n<VSpike> pygi: I definitely have patch.exe .. let me check exactly\n<pygi> VSpike, and see if it accepts \"--dry-run\"\n<VSpike> pygi: yep, I have diffutils, patch and patchutils\n<VSpike> which, bzr shelve?\n<pygi> no,patch\n<VSpike> pygi: yes it does\n<pygi> do you have binary files?\n<VSpike> pygi: \"bzr shelf list\" shows the patches, and \"bzr shelf show 00\" shows the contents OK\n<VSpike> pygi: these aren't binary files, no\n<pygi> VSpike, open shelf.py\n<pygi> lets try something ...\n<pygi> hm, or rather not\n * pygi thinks\n<VSpike> I'm going to have to do it the manual way I think\n<VSpike> i.e. just copy the current files to a \"saved\" dir somewhere and revert :)\n<pygi> VSpike, nah, lets figure it out\n<pygi> could you paste complete output pls?\n<pygi> http://rafb.net/paste\n<VSpike> Cos I also realised the changes I need to shelve span a couple of commmits - they are not just in this revision\n<VSpike> But yeah could spend a couple of mins on it to investigate if you like :)\n<pygi> thanks VSpike :)\n<VSpike> So you want me to bzr shelve the file and paste the complete output?\n<pygi> yup, obviously :)\n<VSpike> http://rafb.net/p/VOwv1b50.html\n<VSpike> I just created a simple test case and it works\n<VSpike> So it's not universally broken\n<pygi> but its broken on certain use-cases...\n<VSpike> Wondering what it could be. Doing two files at one? Files not in root? The fact that ~/projects is a symlink?\n<pygi> VSpike, well, did you try one file?\n<pygi> try it\n<pygi> (I know I'm bugging, please bear with me)\n<VSpike> Ah, it appears to be the subdirectory\n<VSpike> I tested a single file, still broken\n<VSpike> I tried navigating to the location without using the symlink, still broken\n<VSpike> Tried shelving a change in the root project folder, it works\n<pygi> right, so it only allows to shelve what's in the project root...\n<pygi> that's evil behaviour...\n<VSpike> just testing with my simple test case\n<VSpike> Oh\n<VSpike> Hm\n<VSpike> It works in the test case :)\n<pygi> vila, what works?\n<VSpike> I created a sub dir, add a file, committed, edited the file, and tried shelving the change\n<VSpike> worked fine\n<pygi> so hm, whats wrong here ...\n<pygi> VSpike, would you be willing to try a little hack?\n<VSpike> Could it be because they are sometimes unicode files?\n<VSpike> They usually don't contain anything other than a start record\n<VSpike> The rest is normally ascii\n<VSpike> pygi: I was thinking of editing ~/.bazaar/plugins/bzrtools/patch.py to log/dump command line\n<pygi> VSpike, we pretty much know what the command line is\n<VSpike> pygi: what were you going to suggest?\n<pygi> editing  ~/.bazaar/plugins/bzrtools/shelf.py\n<pygi> and change:\n<pygi>       if reverse:\n<pygi>             args.append('-R')\n<pygi> to:\n<pygi>       if reverse:\n<pygi>             args.append('-R -d=yoursubdir')\n<pygi> ergh\n<pygi> args.append('-R -d yoursubdir')\n<VSpike> pygi: that code is not in mine\n<pygi> VSpike, in def _run_patch ?\n<VSpike> It's in patch.py\n<pygi> ah, ok, patch.py then\n<pygi> sorry\n<VSpike> yoursubdir is the full path or relative one?\n<pygi> relative should work\n * pygi is mostly shooting in the dark, never had this problem :p\n<VSpike> Relative from project root I take it?\n<VSpike> I wonder if the code should apply --binary on cygwin?\n<pygi> VSpike, yup, project root\n<pygi> VSpike, I'm not sure if that'd had any effect, considering test case does work ...\n<pygi> but you could try patching sources to do it...\n<VSpike> yeah, that fixes it :)\n<pygi> VSpike, what, the binary thing, or the \"-d\" ?\n<thrope> is there any way to get bzr shelve to show colored diffs? (bzr shelve is a complete revelation by the way - amazingly useful!)\n<thrope> why is it called shelve1 though? is there a new shelve2 coming?\n<VSpike> thrope: strangely, it does show coloured diffs for me\n<VSpike> pygi: the binary thing\n<thrope> oh - I saw the no-color option in the help but I don't get colored diffs\n<pygi> VSpike, could I now convince you to file a bug, and assign me to it?\n<VSpike> Sure. Where do bugs for bzrtools go?\n<VSpike> pygi: the reason my test case worked is possibly because I used cygwin tools to create it\n<pygi> VSpike, yup, mention all that in a bug :)\n<pygi> VSpike, https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bzrtools\n<pygi> mario-danic\n<pygi> thrope, does bzr cdiff works for you?\n<thrope> pygi: yep, works fine\n<pygi> thrope, what bzr/bzrtools version?\n<thrope> bzr 1.9, bzrtools 1.9.1\n<thrope> shelve is an alias to shelve1 for me\n<pygi> yea, its the old shelve ..\n<thrope> how do I get the new one?\n<pygi> its in the mainline perhaps?\n<pygi> not sure\n<pygi> thrope, sudo apt-get install colordiff?\n<pygi> but I think you already have that..\n<pygi> VSpike, thanks for submitting bug when you do btw ;)\n<pygi> and thanks for investigating it\n<awilkins> shelve2 is in bzr.dev now I think\n<awilkins> I've seen at least a couple of commits for it\n<VSpike> pygi: done\n<VSpike> Can you check the report contains all you need?\n<pygi> VSpike, yes, moment pls:)\n<VSpike> #301639 in case your email is slow\n<VSpike> no probs - going to go back to doing what I was doing before :)\n<pygi> VSpike, have fun ;)\n<pygi> VSpike, ah, you have bzr 1.8 ... perhaps that's why you still have colored shelve\n<pygi> VSpike, bug report is perfect, thank you :)\n<VSpike> pygi: yeah, cygwin always seems to lag a version or two\n<VSpike> pygi: yw\n * pygi goes back to sleeping :p\n<VSpike> Not sure why the patch command works without --binary in one direction and not the other\n<VSpike> And also not sure why it passed on another windows generated file when I tested it\n<pygi> VSpike, this is a pretty safe-failover I'd say, so we don't have to break our heads on it :P\n<VSpike> pygi: agreed, it's the right thing to do anyway, I think\n * pygi nods\n<VSpike> I hate thinking about line endings in cygwin anyway.  I just close my eyes and hope it works, mostly\n<pygi> VSpike, its a pretty rare bug ...\n<pygi> only two known occurances so far\n<VSpike> probably worth grepping the source for other cases where sys.platform is tested against win32 and not cygwin and checking they are correct\n<VSpike> Oh, while your about it, can you fix the missing space in the error message? :)\n<VSpike> s/your/you're/\n<pygi> sure sure\n<VSpike> hehe thx\n * pygi writes that down somewhere\n<VSpike> echo \"TODO: fix space in error message\" > /dev/null ;)\n<pygi> :p\n<VSpike> it's the only task manager you need\n<pygi> my head still serves me, so I'm fine :p\n<pygi> ok, can I  go to sleep now or is there anything else I can help you with? :)\n<VSpike> Nope, sleep away :) Thanks for the help\n<pygi> no,thank YOU!\n<pygi> laters\n<pygi> awww\n<pygi> awilkins, poke\n<pygi> awilkins, no, no own implementations of pull/push/whatever\n<pygi> bzr can only access branches that are url-addressable\n<pygi> awilkins, we can probably do a workaround for it to work on Win once its more then proof of concept\n<pygi> awilkins, third, as jelmer said, plan is to move infrastructure for it in core\n<pygi> awilkins, and what do you have against ducks? :p\n<markh> I find they keep acting like a goose! ;)\n<jelmer> pygi: hi\n<jelmer> awilkins: hi\n<markh> py23\n<markh> oops :)\n<jelmer> awilkins: still there?\n<jelmer> hi markh :-)\n<markh> hi jelmer :)  You've been busy :)\n<jelmer> I was a bit disappointed by how little work the local-branches stuff was\n<jelmer> It's less then 200 lines of code, so I regret not writing it earlier\n<markh> heh - everything seems so much simpler the more experienced you get at doing it :)\n<pickscrape> jelmer: can you create local-branches of remote branches, if you know what I mean?\n<jelmer> pickscrape: not directly\n<pickscrape> That would be useful. You could then add a command to allow you to 'pull-all' or similar.\n<jelmer> pickscrape: You'll get that for free once this is all a bit more integrated in the bzr core\n<jelmer> (including pulling of multiple branches)\n<pickscrape> sweet :)\n<jelmer> it'll require a new bzrdir format though, so that means upgrading existing bzrdirs\n<awilkins> jelmer: Hi\n<jelmer> awilkins: you were having trouble building 0.5 ?\n<awilkins> jelmer: I had to put back stdbool.h\n<awilkins> (the included one)\n<awilkins> jelmer: After that it builds, but doesn't work for me\n<awilkins> Did you get the trace off the pastebin\n<jelmer> awilkins: We should probably fix the include path instead to use subvertpy\n<awilkins> jelmer: Yes, that would work (pardon my complete C-noobness)\n<awilkins> I tried to learn C when I was a teenager but the lack of cheap textbooks and no internet rather killed that before it started\n<jelmer> awilkins: do you perhaps have subvertpy installed manually as well?\n<awilkins> jelmer: I think I used the script but I had to copy the pyd files manually\n<awilkins> I'll check and see if there is an egg-info\n<jam> speaking of jelmer... how much do you know about the FTP spec? It seems our FTP \"readv\" support is basically just read the whole file and extract the bits we need.\n<jam> It might be nice to actually use whatever partial-read support is available from FTP\n<jelmer> jam: Yeah, that seems to be the main downside compared to sftp atm :-(\n<jam> which is a rather large one :)\n<jelmer> awilkins: the pyd files should end up in bzrlib.plugins.svn.subvertpy, not in subvertpy at the top-level\n<awilkins> jelmer: Ah, so subvertpy shouldn't be a package on it's own then\n<awilkins> I just tripped an assertion in 0.4 as well\n * awilkins is a pita\n<CardinalFang> Hi all.  How can I find the revision where a file was removed?\n<awilkins> CardinalFang: You have to run the whole log in verbose mode to do so\n<awilkins> You must be the 4th person to ask in here at least\n<awilkins> Someone put it in the FAQ!\n<CardinalFang> :)  I am asking as the proxy for someone else in my org.\n<CardinalFang> Maybe there are others here.\n * CardinalFang waves!\n<CardinalFang> I don't suppose \"-m FN\" will work.\n<awilkins> CardinalFang: I don't think so. It's fairly easy to modify the log command to list the revisions a file participates in if you know it's file-id, but alas, deletion is now one of the ways a file particicpates in a revision due to the way that invent\n<awilkins> ories work\n<awilkins> *not one of the ways\n * CardinalFang writes some sed to print the log.\n<verterok> hi\n<verterok> is there any problem in rich-root -- push -->  non-rich-root?\n<LarstiQ> verterok: yes, there is\n<verterok> LarstiQ: it can be done? or is a one way conversion?\n<jelmer> verterok: can't be done\n<verterok> jelmer: LarstiQ: thanks a million!\n<jelmer> LarstiQ: While you're here... I'm considering adding /etc/init.d/bzr file to start the readonly smart server\n<jelmer> does that sound sensible?\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: what will it read from?\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: And I'd disable starting it by default.\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: other than that, I'm missing context :)\n<jelmer> LarstiQ: yeah, it would require some variables in /etc/default/bzr\n<jelmer> (directory to share and enable/disable)\n * LarstiQ nods\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: how about when people want to share multiple directories? SOL?\n<jelmer> They'd just have to add symlinks/bind mounts inside the directory they're sharing\n<LarstiQ> does that work? :)\n<jelmer> there's only a single namespace anyway\n<jelmer> bind mounts definitely work, not sure about symlinks\n * LarstiQ is thinking of branches symlinked into that namespace, and their repository being outside of it\n<LarstiQ> I'm rather sure that would break\n<jelmer> yeah, that would definitely break\n<LarstiQ> hmm, maybe wait till that happens and then note it\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: what protocols would it be reachable on?\n<jelmer> LarstiQ: just bzr://\n<jelmer> it'd just run \"bzr serve ...\"\n<LarstiQ> hmja\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: if it's disabled by default, why not\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: svn-push is the right command to use to push a new branch, right?\n<jelmer> LarstiQ: yep\n<jfroy|work> jelmer: morning\n<jelmer> jfroy|work: hi\n<jfroy|work> So my patch has allowed me to bypass the bad properties (which I cannot remove) by globally changing the bzr-svn prefix. That's a hack of course, but the next course of action would be to add a new property, bzr:prefix-override, which could be set on the root directory of an svn branch, which bzr-svn would read first and act accordingly. Or perhaps it would be better to have that as a repository option in subversion.conf for example.\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: you might need more information for #301763 ?\n * LarstiQ goes home\n<jelmer> LarstiQ: can you perhaps print the variables in that assert?\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: sure\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: except, I shut down that machien leaving work, and from another machine I don't get the assert (still diverged branches though)\n<jelmer> LarstiQ: any particularly interesting messages in ~/.bzr.log ?\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: hmm, Guessed repository layout: TrunkLayout(0), guess layout to use: CustomLayout(['branches/spitfire/spitfire5'],[]) maybe\n<Peng_> Bundle Buggy's queue has gotten a bit long.\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: after that, it's just the DivergedBranches error\n<mwhudson> 'pull -d' is awesome\n<mwhudson> more commands should support -d though\n<LarstiQ> yes, they should\n<LarstiQ> although I'm not sure what `bzr init -d a b` would do\n<mwhudson> i think that init and init-repo can probably get away without it\n<mwhudson> (i guess init -d a b should create a branch at b/a?)\n<mwhudson> um a/b\n<LarstiQ> I suppose so\n<mwhudson> but i don't think it's a good idea :)\n<LarstiQ> mwhudson: any other commands that should not have a -d?\n<mwhudson> LarstiQ: actually, further to init, it's not really clear how it would interact with commands that also take a relpath\n<mwhudson> like 'add'\n<mwhudson> or 'revert', which is actually what i wanted it for\n<mwhudson> i don't think 'alias' needs it ;-p\n<LarstiQ> haha :)\n<LaserJock> anybody know if it's possible to see if a branch has been updated (i.e. there's something to pull) without doing a pull?\n<pickscrape> bzr missing\n<LaserJock> pickscrape: thanks\n<LaserJock> now I need like muli-missing :-)\n<LaserJock> *multi-missing\n<dwt> hey guys, I'm trying to find the equivalent of \"hg addremove\" in bzr - that is autodetecting a file move\n<dwt> but I don't seem to be able to find the right keywords for google and the help system :/\n<jelmer> I think there was a plugin that can do that\n<LarstiQ> dwt: what exactly does addremove do?\n<LarstiQ> you could just `bzr add`, but then it wouldn't actually store a move\n<LarstiQ> just a remove and an add\n<dwt> well the thing about addremove is that it autodetects any moves that did happen\n<dwt> which it can also do based on similarity (configurable) and in a demonstration mode so one can see what it detected but it doesn't record it in the repo\n<LarstiQ> right\n<luks> dwt: http://bzr.oxygene.sk/bzrbrowse.cgi/bzr-plugins/automv\n<luks> it works only for files, though, not directories\n<dwt> well thats a start\n<dwt> thanks\n<Peng_> Ooh, my weird error pulling one branch has changed to a \"delta references to items not in its repository\" one. ...How do I solve that?\n<rockstar> Wow.  There's a REALLY good article on bzr in Python Magazine this month.\n<jelmer> LarstiQ: were any properties changed in the revision that went kaboink?\n<LarstiQ> jelmer: only bzr revisions set by svn (the pushed revisions never existed in svn before)\n<dwt> Uhm, another quick question: my autocompletion doesn't seem to work in \"bzr shell\" anymore\n<dwt> is there a new configuratio option that I need to turn on?\n<mamatat_> hi do people use rpush? i just tried push-and-update and you need to type password 3x each push :S\n<LarstiQ> mamatat_: I doubt it.\n<LarstiQ> that is, I doubt people use it.\n<mamatat_> what rpush?\n<LarstiQ> mamatat_: I think it's likely it asks often :)\n * LarstiQ nods\n<hiredman> uh\n<mwhudson> what is rpush?\n<hiredman> passwords? people still use those?\n<jelmer> mwhudson: rsync-based push\n<jelmer> IIRC\n<mwhudson> oh right\n<mwhudson> i thought that was rspush\n<derekS> so i think i know the question (and i htink i have asked before), but i just want to be sure. Is there any current way to branch a subfolder of a bzr branch?\n<dwt> I'm not getting this, there should be autocompletion in \"bzr shell\" right?\n<dwt> the documentation seems to mention it - but whenever I type a \"tab\" it just shows up verbatim\n<dwt> I'm on mac os x\n<dwt> is this maybe a known bug?\n<bob2> derekS: bzr split, but it won't save you any space (the branch will contain the history of the whole original branch)\n<derekS> bob2: but logically it will make more sense right?\n<bob2> does os x include readline?\n<derekS> bob2: i don't have big repos, i use this as a personal system. I write tons of scripts for work and I modify them a lot, to the point where i ahve to  versions\n<derekS> *multiple versions\n<poolie> jelmer: could you merge the fix attached to bug 215674, since you gave it a tweak?\n<ubottu> Launchpad bug 215674 in bzr \"uncommit needs an option for saving commit messages\" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/215674\n<jelmer> poolie: sure, I'll have a look\n<jelmer> lifeless: hi\n<jelmer> poolie, lifeless: I'm still looking for feedback about https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/bazaar/2008q4/049564.html; some quick comments about it would be really appreciated.\n<poolie> i'll look\n<poolie> done\n<jelmer> poolie: Thanks!\n<poolie> np\n<poolie> i'd be interested to hear (maybe in the branch mixin rfc thread) about what would make our base classes easier to derive from\n<jelmer> I'll reply there as well, but in short: it's already very easy to derive from the base classes\n<jelmer> it would be nice to have get_inventory_xml() / get_revision_xml() and the like be specific to BzrBranch\n#bzr 2008-11-25\n<poolie> ok\n<lifeless> jelmer: hi\n<meoblast001> why isnt the bzr server at launchpad.net working\n<mwhudson> it's not?\n<indigo> is there a command to pull uncommitted changes from one working tree to another?\n<indigo> say i started to make some changes and decided i should have made a branch\n<indigo> my memory says yes, but not enough to find it in the docs.\n<bob2> merge can\n<bob2> you could also 'switch' that working tree to a branch\n<beuno> bzr merge --uncommitted\n<indigo> that's the one\n<indigo> thanks\n<Spaz> o_O\n<Spaz> /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Crypto/Hash/SHA.py:6: DeprecationWarning: the sha module is deprecated; use the hashlib module instead\n<Spaz>   from sha import *\n<Spaz> /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Crypto/Hash/MD5.py:6: DeprecationWarning: the md5 module is deprecated; use hashlib instead\n<Spaz>   from md5 import *\n<Spaz> with bzr\n<Spaz> has this been fixed yet?\n<spiv> Spaz: I think so; certainly bzr.dev seems to try hashlib first.\n<mwhudson> Spaz: that looks like a problem in pycrypto, not bzr\n<Spaz> huh\n<spiv> mwhudson wins today's prize for reading comprehension\n<spiv> Arguably bzr should be suppressing all DeprecationWarnings.\n<spiv> They aren't much use to end users, they're really messages to developers.\n<spiv> So it'd be reasonable for \"bzr selftest\" to report them, but maybe nothing else should.\n<spiv> (unless you look in ~/.bzr.log or pass a -Ddeprecations flag)\n * spiv finishes for the day\n<vila> hi all\n<poolie1> hello vila!\n<vila> hi poolie ! I thought you were already gone in vacations...\n<poolie1> i was yesterday, but just for one day\n<vila> haaaa, ok\n<schizoschaf> is there a book on bazaar?\n<bob2> no\n<AfC> Is somebody working on a book on bazaar?\n<noodles_20> AfC: not that I'm aware of.\n<loxs> hello folks, does bazaar provide a way for customized user permissions, like this is possible with svn?\n<AfC> loxs: Execute bit has been supported since the beginning.\n<AfC> loxs: are you looking for more than that?\n<spiv> loxs: you mean access control on the repository itself?\n<AfC> spiv: (oh, right)\n<loxs> yes. the central one... I want to be able to give various users permissions to only commit code to a particular directory/file\n<spiv> loxs: the simplest solution is to use ordinary user accounts and filesystem permissions to restrict write access per branch. (or per project, if you use a shared repository per project, as is common.)\n<spiv> loxs: depending on what you're looking for, you *might* be interested in using a tool like PQM (https://launchpad.net/pqm) as a gatekeeper that vets commits to a central branch, e.g. to make sure all commits pass \"make check\"\n<spiv> loxs: I don't know of any out-of-the-box ways to restrict write access of just particular directories/files within a branch.  You could probably configure or extend PQM to do something like that, if PQM's workflow suits your use case.\n<spiv> loxs: but it'd probably be simplest to make separate branches for those parts of your tree, and use regular filesystem permissions.\n<spiv> If commits to the central branch are exclusively done over bzr+ssh, you could write a plugin for the server that installs a pre_change_branch_tip hook function to vet the commit.\n<spiv> While a server-side pre_change_branch_tip hook should work well in theory, I don't think there's much infrastructure to make writing those sorts of hook functions convenient yet.  (it's not well documented how to write a hook function that gets a list of files that are touched by the proposed revision, for instance)\n * spiv -> bed\n<loxs> thanks folks\n<lfaraone> hi, what's the difference between branch and checkout?\n<luks> lfaraone: the commands or the terms in general?\n<lfaraone> luks: both.\n<luks> let's start with the terms first, then :)\n<luks> a checkout is the area you work with, it's basically the working tree with some local metadata\n<luks> every checkout is linked to a branch, and this branch can be either local or remote\n<luks> so that if you commit the working tree, it will update the linked branch\n<luks> and it's also possible to have 'bound branch', which is a branch that will update another remote branch on commit\n<lfaraone> ah.\n<luks> so, when you run 'bzr checkout --lightweight', it will create a local checkout bound to a remote branch\n<lfaraone> Now a more practical question: I'm trying to do work on a svn branch, but it has 6959\n<lfaraone> revisions, and this is over ssh. can I check out the most recent rev?\n<luks> and 'bzr checkout' will create a local checkout, local branch and the branch is bound to another remote branch\n<lfaraone> s/branch/repo/\n<luks> with bzr-svn?\n<lfaraone> luks: yeah.\n<luks> then just 'bzr branch svn+ssh://host/path/to/svn/repo'\n<luks> (or whatever is the scheme svn uses for ssh named)\n<lfaraone> luks: I don't want to download the complete branch history, I only need the most recent rev.\n<lfaraone> luks: it's going to take an age that way.\n<luks> lfaraone: you can try 'bzr checkout --lightweight ...', but I doubt it will be any faster\n<luks> lfaraone: or just use svn, if you don't intend to commit to it :)\n<lfaraone> luks: heh...\n<luks> bzr-svn needs to know the metadata about the whole history\n<luks> so at minimum that needs to be downloaded\n<luks> how do you want to use bzr with no history, though?\n<Tak> why is it that sometimes I can just pull, and other times I have to pull and then update? (for source-level changes to be reflected in my working branch)\n<jelmer> that should only happen if you are pulling into a remote branch\n<jelmer> or if \"bzr pull\" crashes\n<Tak> does it make a difference if I'm using bzr-svn?\n<jelmer> no\n<Tak> how about olive?\n<jelmer> You use olive to pull, you mean?\n<Tak> yes\n<Tak> well, in this latest instance\n<jelmer> perhaps it's a bug in olive then\n<Tak> I've had it happen before as well; can't remember whether I used olive on the previous occasions or not\n<loxs> is there a way to tell bzr to \"destructively\" update my working tree? I mean, overwrite all the conflicts with the upstream branch?\n<luks> working tree or branch?\n<loxs> working tree.... I don't want any conflicts. I just want to synchronise with the upstream branch\n<luks> what command did you run?\n<luks> (that produced the conflicts)\n<loxs> bzr up\n<luks> oh, I don't know then\n<loxs> I had changed files and I don't want the changes\n<luks> I think just bzr revert should do the job, but I don't use checkouts much, so Im not sure\n<loxs> ah, you are right\n<loxs> thanks\n<jelmer> asabil: hi\n<asabil> hi jelmer\n<jelmer> asabil: What happened to your \"branch description\" patch?\n<jelmer> Did it make it in?\n<asabil> I don't remember so\n<asabil> that was over a year ago\n<asabil> the main issue was that it was handled in the same way as branch nicks at that time\n<jelmer> nm, just found it: http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/project/bzr/request/%3C6b4de4d80709132323o2c9603ebscce92c066f473919%40mail.gmail.com%3E\n<asabil> :)\n<jelmer> looks like it's mainly waiting for formatting fixes\n<jelmer> do you intend to finish it?\n<asabil> jelmer: well I cannot promise anything\n<awilkins> slashdot.org\n<awilkins> oops\n<jam> vila: ping\n<vila> jam: pong\n<jam> How's it going?\n<vila> fine :)\n<jam> I BB:tweak'd your --forward patch\n<jam> And was wondering what you thought of the feedback\n<vila> About to call it a day, but deep into content conflicts while a bug bzr check is sucking my CPU cycles :)\n<vila> s/bug//\n<vila> Just a sec\n<vila> \"direction\" into 'get_view_revisions': I agree with your doubts, but the results are correct...\n<jam> as long as you have tested it directly I'm happy enough with that\n<jam> I can see how it would work because of the \"by-depth\" stuff\n<vila> but still, reverse_by_depth make heads explode when coding _:?\n<vila> otherwise, full agreement with the other remarks and thanks for catching them !\n<vila> This is where review rocks IME, you hack-hack-hack and the result becomes clearer... for the reviewer :)\n<vila> anyway, thanks for the review, I'll recheck filter_revisions_touching_file_id before submitting (playing with it right now for another need :)\n<loxs> is cygwin the only way to allow windows machines to connect to bazaar repositories vie sftp?\n<loxs> or ssh+bzr\n<jam> no\n<jam> loxs: If you have 'paramiko' installed we don't need cygwin at all\n<jam> (and it is bzr+ssh, for what it's worth)\n<jam> The standalone win32 installer should include paramiko\n<jam> Available here: https://edge.launchpad.net/bzr/1.9/1.9\n<jam> or as a direct link: http://edge.launchpad.net/bzr/1.9/1.9/+download/bzr-setup-1.9.exe\n<Tak> is bzr-svn part of the windows installation now?\n<noodles_20> Any bzr people who knows how to restore a branch when seeing \"Supplied history does not follow left-hand parents\" errors? splodge has a question on #launchpad...\n<jam> noodles_20: 'bzr reconcile' fixes it (albeit it also tries to fix a bunch of other stuff at the same time). I think you can also \"bzr push --overwrite .\" to have the local branch clean itself up.

I've written a plugin to limit who can access a repository via bzr+ssh.  Right now, an exception is thrown (errors.PermissionDenied) if the user doesn't have access, but it creates an InternalError on the client side\n<synic> is there a way to tell the server just to send something like: bzr: ERROR: Not a branch:\n<mwhudson> synic: _usually_ a permissiondenied on the server side is correctly translated to one on the client side (these days)\n<mwhudson> synic: can you pastebin the client side traceback?\n<synic> yeah\n<synic> http://rafb.net/p/bLjMHZ58.html\n<mwhudson> synic: maybe check with spiv, but it looks like a bug\n<synic> well, it accomplishes the goal, but yeah, it does appear to the user as a bug within bzr\n<synic> and asks them to file a bug report\n<synic> probably because of how I designed the plugin\n<mwhudson> synic: you might also want to try with a newer bzr client\n<mwhudson> there have been related bugs fixed since 1.6.1 i think\n<synic>  ah.\n<synic> well, all in all, though, that gitosis port works.\n<mwhudson> cool\n<spiv> synic: I'm pretty sure bzr.dev (and probably 1.9) will handle that better.\n<synic> yeah, trying it now\n<synic> bzr: ERROR: Permission denied: \"test\": : You do not have read access for this repository.\n<synic> yeah, that looks tons better\n<mwhudson> cool\n<synic> thanks :)\n<slangasek> jelmer: have you had any luck yet with that bzr-svn bug (grub merge)?\n<spiv> synic: you're welcome :)\n<synic> man, the bzrlib code is so cool ... compared to what I'm used to reading anyway.

You guys had any luck running a bzr smart-server on Vista?\n<spiv> AFAIK the TCP server works fine.  I think I recall hearing about someone using it over HTTP with NTLM auth at some point, I'm not sure which version of Windows though.\n<grettke> Thanks. Strangest thing, Vista seems to be blocking the smart server. It allows Perl echo servers to run, and I can access bzr locally, but it doesn't show up over the netwoek. It is Vista that is doing something weird.\n<spiv> grettke: try explicitly using the external IP address in the --port argument?  e.g. --port 1.2.3.4:4155\n<grettke> spiv: Will do.\n<grettke> spiv: That does it. Why is this necessary? There is something with which I am not familiar because it didn't occur to me to bind it in that manner.\n<AfC> (is that the IPv6 bug again?)\n<AfC> grettke: (we had to do that, but in our case it was a problem of `bzr serve` not starting (blowing up) and this forced it to think of the address as IPv4 only which made it work right)\n<spiv> grettke: good question, it might be to do with IPv6\n<spiv> Or it might be that passing None as the host to Python's socket.listen method is choosing the wrong interface for some reason.\n<spiv> grettke: it might be related to https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/293697\n<ubottu> Ubuntu bug 293697 in bzr \"bzr serve shows error TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting\" [High,Confirmed]\n<AfC> grettke: (this was on a Linux server, so even more tangential to what you're asking about)\n<spiv> Hmm, actually, I don't think that's the bug I was thinking of.\n<spiv> Ah, https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bugs/286871 is what I was thinking of.  That's also what AfC is referring to.\n<ubottu> Ubuntu bug 286871 in bzr \"IndexError raising CannotBindAddress error starting bzr serve\" [Medium,Confirmed]\n<grettke> spiv, AfC, ubottu: I had pretty much ruled out the router, the switch, the other computer, and even bzr since I can access from the server box itself, just not other computer; the last thing about which I wondered was whether or not I should disable IPv6 completely on the card.\n * AfC {chortle}s at the addressee list in the above line\n<AfC>  grettke: I imagine you can just specify a 4 byte IPv4 address as Andrew suggested and move on. I haven't the faintest whether Microsoft uses IPv6 internally in its operating system (if it did, then turning it off might make things go splat) or for the E.T. phone home \"feature\".\n<grettke> Thanks everyone, now I can sleep well again; this has been a thorn in my side I tell you!\n<spiv> grettke: you could try --port 0.0.0.0:4155 to further narrow down what's going wrong.  If that works, it suggests that it's trying an IPv6 address.\n<spiv> grettke: if it doesn't, it suggests for some reason passing None as the host is causing it to bind to the wrong interface (or perhaps simply that it's not binding to all interfaces).\n<spiv> grettke: either way, a bug report with the details would be good I think.\n<grettke> spiv: That does work: bzr serve --port 0.0.0.0:4155\n<grettke> spiv: Will do.\n<grettke> bye guys\n<mtaylor> help? \"bzr: ERROR: [Errno 14] Bad address\"\n<mwhudson> mtaylor: that's a new one\n<mtaylor> mwhudson: well that's not what I want to hear . :(\n<mwhudson> mtaylor: what were you doing?\n<spiv> mtaylor: which version?\n<spiv> mtaylor: and which OS?\n<mtaylor> mwhudson: I get it doing just about anything - bzr diff , bzr commit\n<mtaylor> spiv: opensolaris\n<spiv> mtaylor: I think this may be a bug that was recently fixed in bzr.dev\n<mtaylor> and version is...\n<spiv> mtaylor: ah, yep, then it probably is that bug.\n<mtaylor> spiv: 1.9\n<mtaylor> ok\n<mtaylor> phew.

Is that what you are using?\n<jelmer> james_w, no, we're the standard loggerhead package - which uses start-loggerhead\n<james_w> using serve-branches can display the hierarchy nicely\n<james_w> going by one of the bug reports it sounds like that is what would be preferred\n<jelmer> ah, wasn't aware they're actually doing different things these days\n<mwhudson> serve-branches -- new, perhaps a little dwimmish, liked\\\n<mwhudson> start-loggerhead -- old, crappy, i personally hate it\n<james_w> I'm not sure where the extra port is coming from, do you have the public URL setting in loggerhead.conf?\n<jelmer> mwhudson, but serve-branches doesn't use loggerhead.conf, does it?\n<mwhudson> jelmer: no, you have to use --style options\n<jelmer> it would be nice if there was a way to just get the stylistic improvements by setting some variable in lgogerhead.conf\n<mwhudson> you mean the serving from directories stuff?\n<mwhudson> because there isn't any real difference in appearance, i thought\n<jelmer> I'd like to get the hierarchy that serve-branches has\n<mwhudson> what else can't you get with serve-branches?\n<jelmer> That's the only bit I'm aware of that's differnet (but I may not be very well informed)\n<mwhudson> then why not use serve-branches?\n<mwhudson> i realize you can't use loggerhead.conf so neatly, but a little shell script with --port this and --host that doesn't seem so hard\n<jelmer> mwhudson, this is for the debian package, which already uses start-loggerhead\n<mwhudson> jelmer: now you've lost me\n<mwhudson> which part of the debian package?\n<jelmer> the init script\n<mwhudson> oh right\\\n<mwhudson> did you see that trunk loggerhead has one of them too now?\n<jelmer> the alternative is for me to allow the user to configure a choice between start-loggerhead and serve-branches\n<jelmer> and to confuse users since their configuration for address/port to listen on is in different places\n<mwhudson> ah\n<james_w> the loggerhead.conf suits a package really well, and so having an option to turn on the hierarchical browsing would be great IMO\n<mwhudson> i'm fine with the idea of configuring serve-branches from a config file\n<mwhudson> i'm not really fine with it being the same as loggerhead.conf currently is though\n<lifeless> or\n<lifeless> nuke loggerhead.conf completely\n<lifeless> and let a /etc/defaults/loggerhead set variables\n<lifeless> (in the packaging)\n<jelmer> mwhudson, serve-branches doesn't necessarily have to support a config file - it can just be a tool to quickly get a loggerhead up\n<jelmer> the important thing (for me at least) is that the same functionality is in start-loggerhead\n<fullermd> Looks like Dragonfly finished their git conversion.\n<mwhudson> jelmer: i don't see why you so want start-loggerhead\n<jelmer> mwhudson, it means I don't have to worry about the configuration (since except for enabling it, it is all outside of /etc/default), because it can fork for me as well as log etc, and because it's already there (otherwise I'd have to make sure there's a smooth transition from start-loggerhead to serve-branches)\n<mwhudson> jelmer: well if you'd _asked_ me when you were packaging loggerhead, i'd have told you to stay away from it ;-p\n<mwhudson> jelmer: when serve-branches is feature compatible, we can do a compatibility shim somehow\n<lifeless> mwhudson: or, as some of the features are insane\n<jelmer> mwhudson: at that time, serve-branches wasn't even installed by setup.py IIRC..\n<lifeless> mwhudson: you could just deprecate it\n<mwhudson> there's always going to be a spot of friction though, because the way the branches are specified\n<mwhudson> +of\n<hiredman> jelmer: ping\n<jelmer> hiredman, pong\n<hiredman> Yo\n<jelmer> hiredman, you were hitting issues in bzr-git\n<hiredman> Yes.\n<hiredman> I was not able to branch from a git tree, or whatever you call it\n<hiredman> I am not even sure how complete bzr-git is suposed to be\n<hiredman> http://gist.github.com/29575 was the output\n#bzr 2008-11-27\n<lszyba1> hello, I did:  bzr tag -r 77 datahub-release-0.7  now how do I push this to launchpad?\n<lszyba1> Do I have to recommit and push?

About to try about bzr for the first time\n<CaMason_> does bzr support keywords at all? I namely want to use the $id $ feature of svn if possible\n<james_w> CaMason_: not currently, it is in development though\n<CaMason_> james_w: ok. It's not that important for me at the moment :)\n<CaMason_> I love the fact this is portable. I can now continue my dev and commits whilst on the train :D\n<CaMason_> I did like tortoiseSVN though. I'm on vista x64, so I can't use the gui\n<CaMason_> although the eclipse plugin seems good\n<Lo-lan-do> I thought there was a TortoiseBZR too?\n<CaMason_> yes but it doesn't support x64, I believe\n<Lo-lan-do> Ah.  Pardon me for being ignorant of these things, I haven't touched Windows for years.\n<CaMason_> there's only a couple of things holding me back in windows, and thats the Adobe suite, and better multi-monitor support\n<CaMason_> I need access to the Adobe stuff, and there's no elegant working solutions for the suite. Also, I use 3 or 4 monitors, and the support with distro's like ubuntu isn't as good as the windows implementation, yet\n<Lo-lan-do> I wasn't tryng to elicit a discussion on that subject, just apologising, really ;-)\n<CaMason_> Lo-lan-do: I was just voicing my dissapointment with Adobe's lack of linux builds, as usual :)\n<CaMason_> hrm.. I've got a couple of symbollic links in my project. I just did a bzr add, and commit. Now 'bzr status' shows those 2 links as 'unknown' with @ appended\n<CaMason_> Any ideas on the best approach now?\n<james_w> CaMason_: what happens if you \"bzr add <symlink>\"?\n<CaMason_> it seems it added the folder, but not contents (desired)\n<CaMason_> and commit succeeded :)\n<CaMason_> What's the preferred mechanism for seperating lines/sentences with a commit message?\n<james_w> CaMason_: I like to do a one line summary, a blank line, then paragraphs explaining it\n<CaMason_> sorry for my lack of understanding. How would I insert a newline when I'm typing at command line? (linux)\n<james_w> that works well with things like bzr log --line, loggerhead etc.\n<james_w> oh\n<james_w> don't pass -m\n<james_w> and don't type a message\n<james_w> it is possible at the command line, but if you do that you will be given an editor in which to type\n<CaMason_> oh I see! and thanks to uncommit, I can go back and try it on a real commit :D\n<CaMason_> liking bzr already\n<LaserJock> james_w: congrats on the Ubuntu package branches\n<sohail> hi, anyone know the status of bzrp4?

It has never been branched, just created is all.\n<poolie> if it has nothing else in it that you want, you can just rm it\n<grettke> Ok.\n<grettke> If I were to delete and recreate that project, as far as the shared repo is concened, it is not the same as the old one?\n<poolie> right\n<grettke> thanks poolie. bye.\n<spiv> poolie: huh!\n<poolie> mm?\n<spiv> poolie: that change used to pass tests, but now it trips on your new consistency chekc\n<poolie> ah\n<spiv> (the change to remove \"len(self.target._fallback_repositories) > 0\")\n<poolie> yes, that's what i understood you to mean\n<poolie> good thing that check was there i guess\n<spiv> I guess that makes sense, it can't be a straight pack-to-pack copy, some delta records have to be fulltexts.\n<poolie> thumper, spiv: just <http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/77542/> or anything more?\n<thumper> poolie: fixes rather than addresses perhaps?\n<thumper> but yes, that is all I was looking for\n<poolie> i'd kind of like to say what effect this will\n<poolie> have\n<poolie> but, that's mostly defined server side and may go out of date\n<poolie> and i'm not sure off hand what will happen\n<spiv> poolie: that looks reasonable to me\n<poolie> thumper: i just got subscribed to a very active project using code reviews etc\n<poolie> so, congratulations on your feature's popularity\n<spiv> Off hand I believe --fixes lp:NNNN causes that branch to be associated with the bug, and that association's status is set to \"Fix Available\".  I think \"addresses\" is an ok way to summarise that ;)\n<poolie> but it's also an eyewatering amount of email\n<poolie> and i don't really really care about it\n<poolie> possibly i should fix this in my mail client\n<poolie> but i wonder, if i unsubscribed (if i can) whether I'd get a good replacement through the web\n<poolie> basically a timeline view of all merge proposals, comments, and landings\n<spiv> poolie: so I've updated my original InterPackRepo.fetch hack for bug 294479 to add a comment and a NEWS entry.\n<ubottu> Launchpad bug 294479 in bzr \"Vast number of round-trips pushing stacked branch\" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/294479\n<spiv> poolie: I'm just running a full test suite now, in case there's something unexpected, but I don't expect there to be.\n<poolie> so this is setting it through a callback?\n<poolie> i think a comment about why we're doing it, and maybe also something on the constructor parameter to say we don't really want it would make sense\n<poolie> i sent that doc patch to pqm\n<spiv> poolie: right.\n<spiv> poolie: I'll add a comment to the constructor too.\n<jml> you know what would be great?\n<jml> being able to re-order threads in a loom\n<jml> (I guess doing it properly depends on proper cherrypicking, but I'd be happy with a half-arsed solution that was a joy to use)\n<Glenjamin> hey guys, i've just installed bzr1.9 on windows, and i'm getting the error \"Unable to load bzr-svn extensions - did you build it?\" \"cannot import name client\"\n<Glenjamin> anyone know what this actually means?\n<lifeless> jml: its in todo I think, file a bug, yada yada yada\n<awilkins> Glenjamin: It's a packaging bug\n<awilkins> Glenjamin: You installed the python2.5 version?\n<Glenjamin> yes\n<awilkins> Glenjamin: Delete c:\\python25\\lib\\site-packages\\bzrlib\\plugins\\svn\n<awilkins> Unless you actually want to use bzr-svn, of course\n<Glenjamin> and if i want svn i should just install it?\n<awilkins> \"just install it\" is relative on windows\n<awilkins> It's rather tricky to get it built\n<Glenjamin> ah\n<Glenjamin> i probably dont need it for now\n<awilkins> For windows I think you are going to be looking at prepackaged binaries\n<Glenjamin> yeah, i'm fine with that\n<Glenjamin> while i'm here, i dont suppose anyone knows how to get tortoisebzr working on 64bit windows?\n<spiv> poolie: http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/project/bzr/request/%3C20081127231800.GH23611%40steerpike.home.puzzling.org%3E is the updated patch, btw\n#bzr 2008-11-28\n<poolie> spiv, hi\n<poolie> approved\n<spiv> Thanks1\n<thumper> poolie: which project was it using reviews?\n<poolie> stevea's project\n<jml> ok. so how exactly should I do this again (switching the order of a pair of adjacent threads)\n<thumper> a quick question about bzr send\n<thumper> if using `bzr send --mailto foo@example.com` and thunderbird\n<thumper> does the attachment get added for others?\n<thumper> I'm trying to debug a weirdness\n<poolie> how do you mean 'for others'?\n * jml walks away to think about the problem.\n<poolie> jml, i don't know\n<jml> poolie: behold, I show you a mystery\n<spiv> jml: edit your .bzr/branch/last-loom file?

I think that is probably a bug, although not a surprising one.  You can clear pending merges with \"bzr revert --forget-merges\".\n<poolie> This release of Bazaar focusses on performance improvements when pushing\n<poolie> and pulling revisions, both locally and to remote networks.  The popular\n<poolie> ``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` commands, used to interactively revert and\n<poolie> restore work in progress, have been merged from bzrtools into the bzr\n<poolie> core.  There are also bug fixes for portability, and for stacked branches.\n<poolie> how's that\n<spiv> Sounds good, although shelve/unshelve was rewritten rather than merely merged.\n<spiv> I'm not sure the distinction matters for that text, though.\n<poolie> to use internal merge, rather than patch and diff?\n<spiv> Yeah.\n<spiv> poolie: I'm off to SLUG.

I've had a project under bzr control just from bzr init. Now, I've just set up a SFTP connection, and I'd like to make my current repo a central repo on the SFTP server\n<CaMason_> how do I go about doing this?\n<jelmer> CaMason_, bzr push the branch to the sftp server\n<jelmer> after that, you should be able to \"bzr checkout\" it\n<CaMason_> jelmer: thanks, I'm just reading that bit now\n * rocky loves that every bzr repo can be used as-is by merely hooking up network access to it for someone else\n<rocky> i don't think svn was like that right?\n<CaMason_> rocky: nope\n<CaMason_> you know, I think I can use a folder under both SVN and .bzr control..\n<CaMason_> i.e. my local project has a single folder that I want to put on a SVN server elsewhere (for others). If I ignore the .svn files with bzr, it shoudln't cause any conflicts, if I think correctly?\n<rocky> CaMason_: you can probably do something a little slicker with bzr-svn, but jelmer would be the one to poke for that ;)\n<CaMason_> I think I've pushed my current repo to a central location. However, the file sizes are different\n<CaMason_> the central repo seems to be about 500kb big, but my local one is about 700kb\n<KangOl> hi\n<CaMason_> well, I managed to checkout the central branch. so..\n<CaMason_> I assume everything is ok!\n<beuno> CaMason_, bzr optimizes repos, so I wouldn't be surprised\n<KangOl> why doing a merge between 2 branches without common ancestor with cherrypicking doesn't keep the history ?\n<CaMason_> and it seems I've bound my working copy to the central repo now. This is brilliant :)\n<CaMason_> and I can unbind.. brillian. I can now work on the train offline :D\n<beuno> yes, the magic of bzr\n<CaMason_> I have to say, compared to SVN, the setup process has been very painless\n<beuno> CaMason_, blog about it!  the world needs to know!  ;)\n<CaMason_> I will as soon as I get my blog up\n<KangOl> someone can explain me this behavior ?\n<KangOl> ~$> bzr clone -q <urlA> A\n<KangOl> ~$> bzr clone -q <urlB> B\n<KangOl> ~$> cd A\n<KangOl> A$> bzr merge ../B/\n<KangOl> bzr: ERROR: Branches have no common ancestor, and no merge base revision was specified.\n<KangOl> A$> bzr merge -q -r 0..-1 ../B/\n<KangOl> A$> bzr st | grep pending\n<KangOl> pending merges:\n<KangOl> A$> bzr revert -q\n<KangOl> A$> bzr merge -q -r 0..-1 ../B/somedir/\n<KangOl> A$> bzr st | grep pending\n<KangOl> A$>\n<uws> jelmer: bzr-svn seems to think subtrees of my svn checkout are are in different svn repos\n<uws> jelmer: refusing   'bzr commit dir1/somefile dir2/somefile'\n<uws> jelmer: note that this is a svn checkout, not a bzr-svn checkout\n<jelmer> uws, what's the exact error?\n<uws> ERROR: dir1/dir/somefile is not in the same branch as dir22/dir/someotherfile\n<uws> jelmer: ^\n<uws> jelmer: \"bzr root\" in dir2/dir gives dir2/, instead of 2 levels up)\n<jelmer> uws: Ah, that's actually correct.

There's no particular logic to which goes where, other than my judgement... I could just branch it twice, then delete half the files in each side, and go on from there.. but is there a nicer way?\n<lifeless> LeoNerd: what you described is appropriate\n<LeoNerd> I've also seen 'bzr split'.. not sure about that\n<jelmer> LeoNerd, that splits out a specific directory, so would require you to move all of the files for one of the branches into a directory first\n<LeoNerd> Ahh... Hrm.. I suppose I could do that\n<jelmer> LeoNerd, and the result is similar to what you described\n<LeoNerd> Ohright\n<LeoNerd> OK.. So.. I've now created my two new branches on my server, each with their respective halves of the files... How to \"close\" the original branch, disallow further commits?\n<jelmer> chmod?\n<LeoNerd> Ooh. that'd work\n<lifeless> LeoNerd: or rm\n<lifeless> LeoNerd: but someone can always branch from the old branch and do commits; fortunately bzr will merge happily into both new branches\n#bzr 2008-11-29\n<spiv> abentley: it looks like bundlebuggy's mail queue is growing without any new mail getting processed?  http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/mail\n<abentley> spiv: fixed.\n<ToyKeeper> Hmm...   I could have sworn there was a \"--date\" option for commit.\n<ToyKeeper> Looks like this will be as fun as setting the mtime on a symlink.\n<Enisseo> hello everyone!\n<Enisseo> I have a problem Google could not solve\n<Enisseo> does anyone ever tried to post/publish a bzr directory (sub directory of a branch) to a ftp server?\n<Enisseo> did* try*\n<CaMason> I was wondering.. say somebody committed a huge file, would it be possible to remove that file from the repo?\n<CaMason> I know that's near impossible with svn\n<Enisseo> maybe using bzr remove YOUR_FILE --force\n<Enisseo> CaMason: (never done that, but I would say it is technically possible, so maybe this \"--force\" option would do the trick, or a plugin)\n<CaMason> Enisseo: ok. I work with large flash / photoshop files quite often, and sometimes my designers can input a 400MB FLV file by accident. It would be great to be able to remove that to keep the repo size to a minimum\n<Enisseo> CaMason: if you do not want any .flv (or .psd) file to be committed, you can use the bzr ignore command\n<Enisseo> CaMason: but if you only need to limit the size of committed files, I don't know (plugin? configuration file?)\n<CaMason> Enisseo: It's not an exact science, as we DO need to add certain FLVs and PSDs of varying sized. It's things like placeholder/test items that were accidently placed in, that are of the wrong size\n<CaMason> usually the FLVs are embedded within the .fla files when testing, and these are sometimes accidently added\n<Enisseo> CaMason: if you can't find a \"pattern\" (subdirectory, extension, file size...) the files you do not want to add (or want to add) follow, the filter can not be made\n<Enisseo> CaMason: anyway, the bzr ignore command prevent - I think - adding files accidentally, but you still can add them if you do it explicitly\n<Enisseo> CaMason: for example, to prevent committing files with huge size (psd, flv), you set a ignore rule on .flv and .psd files\n<Enisseo> CaMason: but if you need to add some .psd or .flv files, you can still commit them\n<Enisseo> CaMason: this will work fine if you don't often need to commit PSD and FLV\n<Enisseo> (I'm not sure you can add files that match an ignore rule, but tests will tell you)\n<CaMason> Enisseo: sure, I understand you. But that wont help for my current workflow :)\n<CaMason> It's not a problem for me atm.. I'll read up about it another time. Thank you\n<Enisseo> CaMason: sorry I could not help you... maybe someone will, another day ;)\n<hmeland> \"bzr add foo\" will add foo, regardless of whether it matches an ignore rule or not.  \"bzr commit\" will commit all added files, regardless of ignore rules.\n<Enisseo> thank you :)\n<Enisseo> My problem: I want to publish files of my branch to a ftp directory\n<hmeland> To remove files from history, you'd have to \"rebuild\" that history, while omitting the parts that you don't want.  Bazaar doesn't have any built-in support for such operations.\n<hmeland> The \"rebase\" plugin is somewhat handy, though.\n<CaMason> hmeland: ok, nice :) I'll read up about it later on\n<Enisseo> The files are mostly PHP files, so I want bzr to act like a \"website publisher\"\n<Enisseo> Is this possible?\n<CaMason> Enisseo: http://bazaar-vcs.org/BazaarForWebDevs\n<hmeland> Enisseo: AFAIK, bzr works on the full tree; if you want to publish just a subtree, you're free to do so using other mirroring tools.\n<hmeland> Depending on what you mean by \"publish\", I guess...\n<Enisseo> I mean \"copy files\", not publishing a branch\n<Enisseo> In fact, I could do so \"manually\" by uploading an exported directory (export) of my branch\n<hmeland> Ok, then what I said above stands -- I'm not aware of anything in bzr that will help you with that publishing operation.\n<Enisseo> but I thought bzr would do that, only committing changed files\n<hmeland> Uhm, are you saying that you want to _automate_ publishing of that subtree whenever you commit?\n<Enisseo> no\n<Enisseo> Well, my workflow would be:\n<hmeland> Then you've lost me. :-)\n<Enisseo> 1. I commit files locally\n<Enisseo> 2. I finish adding features and fixing bugs so I could release a new version of my project\n<Enisseo> 3. => I \"push/publish\" the project into a prototype directory on my ftp server\n<Enisseo> 4. I fix last bugs that appear while testing the prototype\n<Enisseo> 5. => I \"push/publish\" the project into the production directory on the ftp server\n<Enisseo> 6. I tag the branch\n<Enisseo> the push/publish operation is manually \"launched\", but yes, indeed, I want bzr to automatically copy files that have changed between two publishing operations\n<bob2> bzr-upload plugin\n<Enisseo> bob2: the name sounds nice :)\n<AfC> Yeah, you want the upload plugin\n<AfC> (orthogonally, do you *really* need to tag every time you publish?)\n<Enisseo> AfC: Hmmm... no\n<Enisseo> AfC: But what do you think is wrong with that\n<Enisseo> ?\n<AfC> Manageability\n<AfC> Enisseo: if you have several thousand tags it gets out of control\n<Enisseo> AfC: I do not want to tag every commit I made, only when I publish what I think is a new version\n<Enisseo> 0.1, 0.2, 1.1, 1.2...\n<bob2> why bother?\n<AfC> Enisseo: and there may be scaling problems with hundreds of thousands of tags, I can't remember if that was addressed; it strikes me as the sort of thing that isn't really wise because it's going to be high O()\n<bob2> just have a branch where each commit is a \"publish\" state\n<bob2> all done\n<AfC> Enisseo: if you're just doing \"versions\" then that's fine, of course\n<AfC> Enisseo: I've seen people do an automated tag with a date string or some other nonsense, and then complain that the 14,000 tags they have are in the way.\n<AfC> bob2: well, if the history is linear that won't quite cut it\n<AfC> a merge isn't necessarily a prerequisite to Enisseo publishing.\n<AfC> but that saidm\n<AfC> said,\n<AfC> for people that really are desperate to have huge numbers of \"tags\", an alternative is\n<AfC> to just make an empty (no changes) commit with a commit message indicating $whatever.\n<AfC> THAT will scale just fine, of course.\n<Enisseo> what's the difference between tagging and branching with bazaar?\n<AfC> er\n<bob2> mostly unrelated\n<bob2> branch is a, well, branch, tag is just a label pointing at a particular commit on a branch\n<Enisseo> I thought a tag in bazaar was just a branch\n<bob2> no\n<Enisseo> well, a named branch\n<AfC> no\n<Enisseo> ok\n<bob2> svn is the only system like that, afaik\n<AfC> {sigh}, Subversion screwing up the name space strikes again\n<AfC> Enisseo: you can take a branch from any revision\n<Enisseo> I must have read that from svn, indeed\n<AfC> Enisseo: there are many ways to _identify_ revisions\n<AfC> Enisseo: tags are one of them.\n<AfC> (dates are another, etc)\n<AfC> I commonly do stuff like\n<AfC> $ bzr diff -r tag:v4.0.9\n<Enisseo> so, if a tag is a label of a commit, many tags are just hard to manage, but it does not affect performances, does it?\n<AfC> to find out what I've changed from the last release\n<AfC> another *really* useful one is\n<AfC> $ bzr diff -r ancestor:../mainline\n<AfC> to see what is different about this branch (from a contributor, say) without worrying about what has moved on in 'mainline' in the mean time.\n<Enisseo> the \"bzr diff -r tag:v4.0.9\" command is what I have in mind\n<AfC> Enisseo: sure... but if you're only doing one or two revisions per release, and *frequent* releases, then I imagine you can see the utility dropping.\n<AfC> on the other hand if you don't do that many \"releases\" then you're all fine.\n<AfC> Enisseo: hard to manage (lots of tags), definitely (where lots >>> 100)\n<AfC> Enisseo: I can't say off hand what the performance impact is\n<Enisseo> ok, thanks for the advice ;)\n<AfC> I have a nagging feeling that someone was complaining about it, but I also recall they had like 100,000 tags\n<AfC> and were upset that bzr log was slow :)\n<AfC> if you're not already at hundreds of thousands of revisions, and gigabytes of repository, and tens of thousands of tags, I doubt you'll notice any performance problem.\n<mathrick> jelmer: hmm, why does bzr init in a directory below an svn checkout (but not versioned itself) invoke bzr-svn?\n<jelmer> mathrick, what version of bzr/bzr-svn ?\n<mathrick> jelmer: how do I check bzr-svn version?\n<mathrick> (it's not my copy y'see)\n<jelmer> mathrick, if you know the bzr version, that should be sufficient\n<mathrick> ok, it's 1.9\n<mathrick> jelmer: btw, it seems to segfault on bzr init after upgrading to (python-)subversion 1.5.1 (from 1.4.6)\n<jelmer> mathrick, so you have a svn-versioned directory and one of the children paths has a .bzr directory?\n<mathrick> jelmer: no, I have a svn-versioned directory, and it has a non-versioned subdir that I (or my friend, actually) wants to init as a bzr repo\n<jelmer> mathrick, in that case, this is expected behaviour\n<mathrick> he doesn't care about the svn-versionedness of the parent\n<mathrick> jelmer: what purpose does it serve?\n<mathrick> and, how can I disable it?\n<jelmer> mathrick, sorry, forget that\n<jelmer> mathrick, I can't reproduce this\n<mathrick> jelmer: hmm\n<mathrick> jelmer: I'll try to get a reproducible example for you, sec\n<mathrick> jelmer: okay, I have a minimal dir structure that segfaults for me as well\n<mathrick> (bzr 1.6.1 / svn 1.5.1)\n<jelmer> mathrick, Have you tried 1.9 ? Several things have changed since then\n<mathrick> jelmer: yes, said friend runs 1.9\n<mathrick> jelmer: http://sei.meidokon.net/files/foo.tar.gz\n<mathrick> unpack it, go to foo/bar/, try to bzr init there\n<mathrick> it segfaults\n<jelmer> mathrick, works fine here\n<mathrick> in earlier svn (1.4.6), it'd say the subversion client is too old\n<mathrick> humm\n<mathrick> are you running ubuntu?\n<jelmer> no, debian\n<mathrick> then it seems like something is broken in ubuntu packages\n<mathrick> jelmer: is it invoking bzr-svn at all for you?\n<marcus-b> Hi, I upgraded from bzr 1.3 in Ubuntu 8.04 to bzr 1.6.1 in Ubuntu 8.10, and now I get weird upgrade notices and errors on upgrade: http://pastebin.com/m15418d7  What should I do?\n<jelmer> mathrick, no, it doesn't touch bzr-svn\n<jelmer> I'm running bzr 1.10 though, not 1.9\n<beuno> marcus-b, try:  bzr upgrade --rich-root-pack\n<marcus-b> thanks, that seems to work.  was it a mistake to use rich-root?  what's the recommended format for new repositories?\n<beuno> marcus-b, also remember to upgrade both your branches and your shared repository\n<beuno> why did you choose rich-root?\n<marcus-b> I don't remember.  I think I just chose the latest/greatest at the time\n<marcus-b> I want to go with the masses, no special requirements\n<beuno> jelmer, there's no way to go rich-root -> packs, is there?\n<jelmer> beuno: rich-root-pack\n<jelmer> beuno: there's no particular reason to go back from rich-root though\n<james_w> jelmer: you patch allows you to upgrade an svn checkout to be a bzr branch?\n<beuno> well, PITA, but yes  :)\n<marcus-b> so the new cool kid on the block is packs? :)\n<jelmer> james_w, It's one of the required steps - I'm not sure whether bzr-svn's implementation of Converter works well enough yet\n<james_w> jelmer: madness :-)\n<beuno> marcus-b, actually, it's \"1.9\" format, but I'd say you take it a step at a time  ;)\n<marcus-b> yeah, thanks ;)\n<marcus-b> so how about I go to 1.6.1-rich-root ?\n<jelmer> marcus-b, any reason for going with 1.6.1-rich-root rather than 1.9-rich-root?\n<marcus-b> well, ubuntu 8.10 ships with 1.6.1\n<marcus-b> so, if there isn't a strong reason for a manual update or override...\n<marcus-b> ok, I am taking the ppa ubuntu repository, that's convenient enough for me\n<beuno> that's what I do  :)\n<marcus-b> can I move away from rich-root?\n<bpierre> hi\n<gerel> hey all, short question, if I have changes in one file in this order, rev1 => rev2 => rev3, when I try to see changes between rev1 and rev3, all is fine, now when I try to see, whether the changes were made between rev1 and rev2 or rev2 and rev3, bzr outputs nothing!, does that make sense?\n<gerel>  shouldn't there be a transitive property ?\n<gerel> well, solved, the thing is that \"-rREV1 -rREV2\" isn't the same as \"-rREV1..REV2\", I thought it was\n<Flimm> How can I tag a commit with a launchpad bug?\n<beuno> Flimm, maybe what you're looking for is: bzr ci --fixes=lp:1111\n<beuno> or maybe it's  --fixes lp:1111\n<Flimm> Thanks bueno, you're always here when I need help!\n<CaMason_> if I need to move my central branch to a different server, can I just copy/paste it?\n<bpierre> if it's a standalone branch, yes, it should work\n<CaMason_> time to try, then :)\n#bzr 2008-11-30\n<CaMason_> ack I just did a revert when I didn't mean to. Can I undo that?\n<CaMason_> nv I found a way to fix it\n<ym1> I would like to know if there is a place where the installation/configuration of loggerhead is documented\n<ym1> In fact I am looking for a bzr branch explorer\n<ym1> Based on what I read on Internet it seems that loggerhead is the defacto standard for this\n<GPHemsley> is there a way to convert an existing repository to use --no-trees?\n<evarlast> yes, bzr remove-tree\n<ryanakca> Could one have a ``safepoint'' commit that doesn't show up in the commit log, but only acts as an ``Oh !&^#%, why did I do that... at least I can revert to what I had 5 minutes ago instead of having to revert to the previous commit''... or should I just commit more often?\n<ryanakca> Use case: When you're trying to fix something through trial and error\n<spiv> ryanakca: well, you can commit and then later uncommit then commit again.\n<spiv> ryanakca: But really, why not just keep the commit?\n<ryanakca> spiv: well, if you're going by trial and error, you might endup with 3-4 ``safepoints'' that are absolute rubbish and have no use in a commit log, at least not in a public one :)\n<spiv> ryanakca: maybe.  They might not be totally worthless, and there isn't much harm from leaving them there.\n<ryanakca> spiv: *nod*\n<spiv> ryanakca: especially if this is happening on a branch, when the branch is merged to trunk the details of how that branch evolved aren't very prominent in the history.\n<spiv> If you're working directly on trunk then that's a different matter, but then I'd argue you should be taking advantage of a DVCS and using branches instead :)\n<spiv> You could even manage your experimental work on your branch as another branch, but that workflow is probably a bit too heavyweight for what you're after.\n<ryanakca> spiv: well, I'm the only one working on it at the moment... but it will eventually end up being used in my school, and most likely other schools in my school board...\n<ryanakca> spiv: Anyways, I probably ought to branch when I go by trial and error :)\n<ryanakca> G'night :)\n<spiv> ryanakca: g'afternoon ;)\n<spiv> (It's a bright and sunny 4pm here in Sydney)\n * thumper votes for default log to be short (no merge details)\n<spiv> thumper: bzr alias log=\"log --short\"\n<thumper> spiv: yes I know#\n<spiv> :)\n<thumper> spiv: I'm thinking of all the new users\n<thumper> all those people who go \"gee bzr log is slow compared to xyz\"\n<spiv> \"Won't somebody think of the newbies?\"\n<thumper> spiv: that way people can go \"bzr log --merges\" to show merges (or something)\n<spiv> (Sunday afternoon perhaps not the best time to get a completely serious opinion from me)\n<thumper> and they can take the hit of the graph sort or whatever\n * thumper was reading traceback\n<spiv> We don't get many people saying the log is slow (although we do get some).  And arguably the solution there is to make it fast, not change the output.\n<thumper> spiv: yeah, but one is easier and allows for better comparison of apples\n<spiv> I do think the default log should make the existence of merges visible, so that the way merges are tracked is reasonably discoverable.\n * thumper goes to make brownies\n<spiv> Well, we're not trying to build a tool that's the same as $other_vcs, we're trying to build a better tool :)\n<spiv> So I don't think that's automatically a good reason to change how we work.\n<hiredman> a better tool that interoperates so I can pull stuff from github?\n<spiv> Personally I use --line most of the time.\n<thumper> I think someone should check to see who actually cares to see the merges by default\n<thumper> spiv: I use --line too\n<thumper> hiredman: that is in progress\n * thumper really leaves now\n<hiredman> I know\n<hiredman> I am just being an asshole today\n<spiv> And then \"bzr viz\" for more in-depth exploration of history, but not every user will have the bzr-gtk plugin (or the ability to install it).\n<epsy> Hi, how do I cleanup the .~n~ files?\n<AfC> $ find . -name '*~*'\n<AfC> $ find . -name '*~*' | xargs rm\n<marcus-b> better: find . -name \"*~*\" -print0 | xargs -0 rm\n<epsy> brb\n<LarstiQ> beuno: hmm, I wouldn't say I'm the mastermind\n<LarstiQ> marcus-b: hey! :)\n<LarstiQ> epsy, marcus-b: `bzr clean-tree --detritus` would also remove the .~n~ files\n<marcus-b> LarstiQ: I don't know bzr well, but I do know my unix tools :)\n * LarstiQ nods\n<pygi> hi hi\n<DimmuR> Hello i'm trying to run bzr+ssh.

Perhaps that's causing the issues?\n<dash> I've got a large branch I've cloned from a remote source, and now i'm wishing I'd created a repository for it to go in. Is too late? Can I create a repo without having to re-fetch all that history?\n<pbor> create a new repo and then fetch from the one you cloned locally\n<dash> oh. of course :)\n<CaMason_> my commit actions etc are causing \"X11 initialization failed\" errors when used via SSH\n<pbor> CaMason_: no idea, sorry\n<CaMason_> it was a problem with dbus.

Heck, I was considering a massive printf to replace the index.py file\n<lifeless> Peng_: sed would probably be nicer :P\n<Peng_> Or making it an attribute on Index objects that you could change from Python.\n<lifeless> hi poolie\n<lifeless> Peng_: sure.\n<lifeless> Peng_: or even - shock - a global\n<lifeless> so you don't have to get access to a specific index\n<Peng_> Oh, different methods have different group_sizes.\n<lifeless> yeah there are two\n<lifeless> there is 'how many revisions', where the inventory text size will chew up memory\n<lifeless> and there is 'how many file versions at once', where text sizes (isos!) will chew up memory\n<Peng_> I've never changed it in _terms_for_file_terms.\n<lifeless> sure\n<lifeless> whats in my head is to not guess about what works well for users\n<lifeless> but to graph it out, and choose the place that works best\n<lifeless> the two group sizes are independent\n<lifeless> well, not quite.\n<Peng_> Well...do you want to test both, or just the _index_revisions one?\n<lifeless> the file terms is capped by the index revisions one (can't index morefile changes than occured in a given set of revisions)\n<lifeless> I'd start with the index revisions one, that should give plenty of data\n<lifeless> though it may be confounded (a large index revisions one might use little memory, if the file terms one is driving the peak)\n<mwhudson> does anyone have any recommendations for good conflict resolution tools?\n<lifeless> guns\n<lifeless> lots and lots of guns\n<lifeless> It worked in the matrix.\n<mwhudson> hmm\n<mwhudson> i think i want meld and a much larger monitor\n<bob2> sdiff/ediff in emacs is nice if you already use emacs\n<mwhudson> ediff confuses me a bit\n<mwhudson> what's sdiff?\n<mwhudson> i think the problem is that one branch has moved things around and the other has made small edits to the things being moved\n<bob2> simple mode that highlights in-file conflicts, with some keybindings to pick one or the other or both for each hunk\n<bob2> ah, out of that league, then\n<lifeless> spiv: shall we converse?\n<poolie> lifeless: spiv is away at osdc today\n<poolie> you and i could talk though\n<lifeless> oh!\n<lifeless> didn't realise osdc was here\n<lifeless> should I go down?\n<lifeless> poolie: you're on leave no? but perhaps a quick call could be useful\n<lifeless> poolie: I'll ring your house?\n<spm> poolie: osdc doesn't start till tomorrow? Or is spiv on the org committee or similar?\n<poolie> yes, call\n<mwhudson> osdc starts for realz on wes\n<mwhudson> weds\n<mwhudson> spiv just took the week off anyway i think\n<poolie> planning to look at bug 302698\n<ubottu> Launchpad bug 302698 in bzr \"\"BzrCheckError: Internal check failed: Newly created pack file <bzrlib.repofmt.pack_repo.NewPack object at 0x2e23f90> has delta references to items not in its repository:\" on pushing a stacked branch\" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/302698\n<Peng_> lifeless: OK, I wrote an evil little script for the bzr-search thing. I hope you weren't joking about running \"sed\" over index.py. ;)\n<Peng_> lifeless: Also, if it gets interrupted, things will probably be left in a horrible mess.\n<mathrick> hmm, does anyone here know (and is willing to explain) the difference between a transplant and a normal merge, or do I need to pester #hg?\n<Peng_> mathrick: AIUI, transplants can cherrypick, but it'll create a different revision with different revids and parents and whatever.\n<Peng_> (if we're talking about hg)\n<mathrick> Peng_: hmm, I'll guess I'll just ask the hg guys then\n<Peng_> Good idea. :)\n<lifeless> Peng_: thanks!\n<lifeless> poolie: I need to shoot off to the doctors too today, I forgot to mention it in all the kufuffle\n<mathrick> any idea how hard it'd be to implement \"add-on branches\" (as mentioned in https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/bazaar/2008q4/050022.html )? It strikes me as something you'd really want to have to keep your distro work in sync with upstream\n<mathrick> or is there something I'm not seeing that makes it not a good / redundant idea?\n<Peng_> lifeless: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/YkaM3FCdH5ILeNUOlV0h/ -- did I mention that it's an evil dirty hack and you probably won't like it? :)\n * Peng_ is trying to lower expectations as much as possible.\n<poolie> mathrick: it's probably not technically super hard, more a matter of deciding how you want it to work\n<poolie> robert's idea of having marks of files or regions would probably be good\n<mathrick> poolie: oh, link?\n<mathrick> also, I was thinking about strands of development a'la threads in loom\n<mathrick> just with the opposite effect on your working area\n<lifeless> mathrick: using a loom and cherrypicking down would do it\n<mathrick> lifeless: could you elaborate? I tried to use loom, but decided it does exactly what I don't want with the history when I change threads\n<lifeless> mathrick: well the root problem you have is that its impossible to do a full merge/push from 'development' to 'mainline' *excluding data*.\n<mathrick> yes\n<lifeless> full merge/push always include everything committed\n<lifeless> so you have to cherrypick repeated - do merges specifying paths to merge, or specific revisions\n<mathrick> yup\n<mathrick> I could do it using loom by hand, but it'd require me to switch between threads to get \"development\" and \"testing\" views all the time, which is a pain\n<lifeless> Peng_: sweet\n<mathrick> ie. I couldn't actually run any code when in development thread, and I couldn't edit any when in testing thread\n<lifeless> mathrick: I don't understand why you couldn't run code\n<mathrick> lifeless: sec, lemme sketch that\n<mathrick> lifeless: http://pastebin.com/m23f854c8\n<lifeless> mathrick: edit and commit in testing\n<mathrick> lifeless: but then the changes will be only visible in testing, which means the pushes won't see them. They will be treated as if they were my local conf changes\n<lifeless> mathrick: when you are done, you can go to main, merge -r testing path1 path2\n<mathrick> hmm, lemme parse that\n<mathrick> what's path1 and path2?\n<lifeless> mathrick: you have to cherry pick testing to main, regardless of the toolchain you use, for your stated desire\n<lifeless> paths that you want to merge within the branch\n<lifeless> another way of spelling it is\n<lifeless> switch main; merge -r thread:testing\n<lifeless> bzr revert --forget-merges\n<lifeless> bzr revert server.conf\n<lifeless> bzr commit -m 'whatever'\n<lifeless> mathrick: have you considered 'shelve' though?\n<mathrick> right, but that's exactly what I wanted to avoid. It's heaps of manual work, and if I forget it only once, I have unwanted commits in the mainline I have to deal with\n<mathrick> hence the desire to have a tool which keeps track of what I want and don't want to merge for me\n<mathrick> loom is very nice for when you only merge downstream, but it fails to enable a nice workflow for pushes to the upstream without polluting them with distro patches\n<lifeless> mathrick: so, loom isn't finished; I think this would be great to have streamlined in loom\n<lifeless> there are missing components in bzr core to do a *great* job, but a servicable one should be doable\n<mathrick> lifeless: right, I'd love to have it in loom, although it'd really turn it upside down in some regards\n<lifeless> the current theory is that you would keep one or more threads for 'never send upstream'\n<lifeless> as for how you do the commits, I'd like a commit like 'commit -t main'\n<lifeless> to commit a change to a specific thread\n<mathrick> right\n<lifeless> it probably would want to merge-it-up on the fly\n<mathrick> what does merge-it-up mean?\n<mathrick> now, for something completely different, I have a repo that bzr serve completely dies on -- it uses 500+ MB RAM, then dies with some exceptions when clients try to access the repo. How do I debug it?\n<lifeless> merge each thread to the one above, so that the change does not appear as a change any more\n<mathrick> I guess I'll start for finding 1.9 debs for intrepid\n<lifeless> mathrick: well, firstly, newer bzr has fixed some memory issues from 1.6/1.7/1.8\n<lifeless> mathrick: file a bug with the exceptions though\n<mathrick> lifeless: you mean before I upgrade to 1.9?\n<lifeless> yah\n<mathrick> ok\n<lifeless> if the server side is dying\n<lifeless> (and the server is already running 1.9)\n<mathrick> no, that's the 1.6\n<lifeless> upgrade the server first then\n<mathrick> I'm trying to serve from my machine\n<lifeless> there are debs in the bzr ppa\n<mathrick> oh, interesting\n<mathrick> it dies right away now\n<mathrick> http://pastebin.com/d73b4f039\n<lifeless> mathrick: ugh\n<lifeless> mathrick: uhm, can you run with BZR_PDB=1\n<mathrick> sure\n<lifeless> then you can print self._sockname\n<mathrick> (Pdb) self._sockname\n<mathrick> ('::', 4155, 0, 0)\n<mathrick> humm\n<lifeless> I'd certainly start by filing a bug, but it does look ... odd\n<mathrick> it's getting an ipv6 socket?\n<lifeless> yeah that would fit\n<lifeless> definitely file that bug\n<mathrick> will do\n<mathrick> still, it'd be useful if I could serve in the meantime :)\n<lifeless> comment out that line, or just print the _sockname, rather than prettyising it\n<lifeless> e.g.\n<lifeless> return \"%s\" % self._sockname\n#bzr 2009-11-23\n<maxb> igc: Hi. When you have a moment, could you take a peek at my fastimport MP?  https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~maxb/bzr-fastimport/branch-mapper-stuff/+merge/14594\n<igc> hi maxb: shall do.\n<maxb> thanks\n<igc> james_w: what's the timeframe for changes landing into bzr-builder's trunk? Are you back home now or still travelling?\n<lifeless> igc: hes on leave for a week\n<lifeless> igc: and there is a backlog :P - I have a month old patch now :(\n<igc> james_w, lifeless: I've got some doc and minor code changes ready to go in. I'm asking because if that backlog :-)\n<james_w> things will be leapfrogging rob's change as I have time to merge them\n<igc> lifeless: maybe I should submit them over a non-trunk branch?\n<james_w> I reviewed some on the plane yesterday, but as LP doesn't send you a merge proposal I couldn't merge them\n<igc> hi james_w\n<james_w> hi igc\n<igc> james_w: https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~spiv/bzr-builder/merge-subdirs-479705 looks like it builds on Rob's patch\n<james_w> I'll make it ~bzr-core owned or something one day\n<lifeless> igc: it does\n<igc> james_w: is that still to be reviewed?\n<lifeless> igc: that builds on one of my patches. the really old one is more complex and not relevant for the lp daily builds project\n<james_w> I'd just like to play gatekeeper for a while so that we can learn what the project is\n<james_w> it is still to be reviewed\n<james_w> I have some comments that will make it resubmit, but I asked for the merge proposal early anyway, so we could discuss whether merging subdirs is something that should be supported\n<igc> james_w: my doc tweaks can go over trunk easily\n<igc> james_w: my code changes are pretty trivial so I'll submit those over trunk as well\n<james_w> please do\n<igc> james_w: I just wanted to minimise merge pain for both of us if you were about to release a new trunk\n<igc> given six branches are more recent than trunk, I thought it was worth asking. Anyhow, enjoy your break james_w!\n<james_w> oh, this new prerequisite branches feature is confusing\n<james_w> it's cool and all\n<james_w> but I reviewed this diff I was sent, the mail said nothing about prerequisite branches, and then the diff I got when I merged was a lot larger than I reviewed\n * james_w goes the other way\n<lifeless> james_w: start at the branch with no prerequisite\n<james_w> well, yeah\n<james_w> when was permit_dir added?\n<lifeless> context?\n<lifeless> oh, the test suite?\n<lifeless> a few months back now\n<james_w> time to make dinner anyway\n<thumper> james_w: please file a bug about the prerequisite info missing the email\n<idnar> how do I figure out what merge algorithm bzr merge is using?\n<lifeless> idnar: default is 3-way, anything else is what you told it\n<idnar> ah, okay\n<idnar> the help should probably mention that\n<AfC> I have http://paste.pocoo.org/show/152361/ in my .vimrc; on Gentoo it used to work that when `bzr commit`ing it would [among other things] set tw=70.\n<AfC> For some reason having switched to Ubuntu this doesn't work anymore, though other things in .vimrc are being picked up.\n<AfC> Anyone have even the vaguest notion of why this might not be working, and what I might try doing to re-enable it?\n<lifeless> you might need set nocompat at the top o the .vimrc\n<AfC> lifeless: Hm. Well, /etc/vim/vimrc seems to suggest that Debian has compatible on. I'll try your suggestion right now, though\n<idnar> I think by default, \"vi\" will run vim in vi-compat mode, whereas \"vim\" won't\n<idnar> but I could be confused\n<AfC> idnar: really? oh, that could be the problem\n<lifeless> I've found that I need set nocompat at the top for things to consistently work right\n<AfC> aside: vim.basic, vim.tiny... is there a third I should have installed, vim.kitchen_sink? :)\n<spm> AfC: that's vim.scripts I think you mean... ;-)\n<AfC> spm: just extrapolating from what `update-alternatives --display vi` had to say :)\n<spm> heh\n<lifeless> spiv: note that stuff submitted on the 20th is still on your watch ;)\n<AfC> Ok. Well,\n<AfC> $ export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim\n<AfC> caused things to behave, but prefacing ~/.vimrc with \"set nocompatible\" does not seem to have had any effect\n<idnar> maybe .vimrc isn't even parsed when it's invoked as \"vi\"\n<AfC> so idnar seems to be on the right track, but I'd like `vi` to work properly, not to assume I have some nostalgia for the 1980s vi that we all loved to hate.\n<AfC> Is there a Debian way to make `vi` be Vim as Vim? I thought that was the whole point of the alternatives system\n<lifeless> vim is special\n<lifeless> because the vi/vim behaviour is not separate packages, its 'how was I invoked'\n<spm> AfC: \"set nocompatible\" in your vimrc - I believe should do the trick\n<spm> alternately; just alias vi=vim for a Q&D override\n<AfC> spm: as I just said above, that had no effect\n<spm> gah. soory - missed that. bummer!\n<AfC> spm: yeah, I'm trying to do this \"right\" (in Debian terms) rather than fighting the system\n<AfC> spm: [I would have _hoped_ compatible / nocompatible would have done the trick, seeing as how that was originally [&upstream] the way to take vim and ask it to dumb itself down to classic behaviour]\n * AfC digs some more\n<spm> AfC: strace it on startup? it may be trying an old style vi rc file. name eludes me atm. ??\n<AfC> I guess I could set EDITOR\n<spm> ew\n<AfC> [better than alias, but still somewhat dirty unless done persistently system wide]\n<lifeless> you should set EDITOR\n<idnar> setting EDITOR seems reasonable to me\n<idnar> I'm not sure why it would need to be system-wide, it's just a user setting\n<idnar> I mean, setting EDITOR=vim isn't much different to, say, EDITOR=emacs\n<AfC> idnar: why don't you just pretend for a minute that all the other users on the system want it to be the same\n<AfC> [notably, that root fellow]\n<AfC> lifeless: if that's what you recommend, that's what I will do\n * AfC goes off to learn about how Debian is handling /etc/profile these days\n<lifeless> I set EDITOR so that I get the editor I want\n<phcoder> Hello all. How can one prevent replacement of one branch by another on the server?\n<AfC> lifeless, spm, idnar: thanks for your help\n<lifeless> phcoder: do you mean 'make push prevent push --overwrite' or do you mean 'stop rm -rf' ?\n<phcoder> lifeless: both in preference however I suppose for the second one would need bzr+ssh\n<phcoder> (bzr+ssh only server I mena)\n<phcoder> *mean\n<lifeless> so filesystem permissions are the answer there\n<phcoder> lifeless: but how exactly? We still want people to be able to do a non --overwrite push\n<lifeless> oh\n<lifeless> so you can set append_revisions_only in branch.conf - see bzr help configuration\n<phcoder> lifeless: thanks\n<Peng> Of course, people can do anything if they *really* want to.\n<mwhudson> where's that no-vfs smart server\n<phcoder> Peng: they can send a missile on server, sure ;)\n<Peng> phcoder: Well yeah, but firing up hitchhiker or bzrlib and turning off append_revisions_only or outright manipulating files through the VFS is trivial.\n<phcoder> Peng: if one has only bzr+ssh access can't one instruct daemon to ignore such activity and send a notification e-mail?\n<Peng> phcoder: The VFS is necessary for some normal operations.\n<phcoder> Peng: like? Couldn't one adjust bzr+ssh to handle it as well?\n<Peng> phcoder: Examples? ...I don't know.\n<Peng> phcoder: Of course it's possible (and ideal) to make everything use smart methods, but the work hasn't been done yet.\n<lifeless> even if everything is smart\n<lifeless> append_revisions_only is settable through the smart API\n<Peng> \\o/\n<spiv> Though presumably it'd be easy to add a hookpoint that could restrict changes to branch config objects.\n<Peng> When you run with -Dhpss, can you grep for VFS operations?\n<spiv> Not trivially.\n<Peng> Aww.\n<spiv> Basically, they are the verbs without '.' in them.\n<Peng> Ah. Yeah, that's bad.\n<spiv> So something like \"hpss call.*?'[^.]*?' I guess.\n<Peng> Looks like 2 of the 3 VFS operations on one push I did were getting .bzr/branch-format and .bzr/checkout/format.\n<Peng> Ah, then getting .bzr/bzr-search/format at the end.\n<spiv> Well, that one would be bzr-search's fault ;)\n<Peng> The others could've been the fault of plugins, too.\n<spiv> Probably not :(\n<spiv> You could try -Dhpssvfs if you're really keen.\n<Peng> I'm kind of keen. Is that enough?\n<spiv> Peng: try it and find out :)\n<Peng> I just tried it on a different push. There was only the bzr-search one. :\\\n<lifeless> -Dhpss_vfs\n<Peng> No underscore.\n<Peng> (I don't care enough to reproduce the conditions of the original push. It's a bit complicated.)\n<Peng> (Although I'll probably change my mind in a minute.)\n<Peng> Just did it. push_branch tries open_workingtree calls has_workingtree calls _ensure_real.\n<Peng> Dunno about the other one.\n<Peng> I bet it didn't happen in my other test because the destination branch didn't exist.\n<spiv> Peng: Hmm, I thought I fixed the open_workingtree/has_workingtree case.  Ah well.\n<lifeless> spiv: with my fix you can see it ;)\n<lifeless> spiv: different trigger I think, but yeh still bust\n<lifeless> spiv: you're still piloting the things filed on friday, right?\n<Peng> spiv: I still can't reproduce it with a test branch, though.\n * igc lunch\n * Peng unhappily munches on Cheerios\n<spiv> lifeless: I guess so, although I'm not sure what a good way to track that is\n<spiv> lifeless: possibly we should keep that info on the PatchPilot wiki page?\n<lifeless> spiv: I'd say 'I'm piloting this' in a merge proposal you're piloting\n<spiv> Hmm, yeah.\n<phcoder> Thanks guys.

Nothing like what you quote.\n<igc> OldAl: to reproduce my bug, grab a simple branch from lp, cd to the created directory and run \"bzr qpull --ui-mode\"\n<igc> OldAl: you can try it in a branch of qbzr say :-)\n<OldAl> igc: OK: so it seems that --ui-mode is the magic command?\n<OldAl> igc: So why would anybody want to use it in general?\n<igc> OldAl: nearly all q* commands take a --ui-mode parameter\n<igc> explorer, TortoiseBzr and qbzr-eclipse all call the q* command that way\n<igc> i.e. with that option turned on\n<OldAl> igc: What turns the ui-mode on?\n<igc> OldAl: sending error messages to the console isn't helpful to most users (unless they run every q* command from the console)\n<igc> OldAl: I don't get the question. Using the --ui-mode option turns that mode on\n<OldAl> igc: So if I call from CLI \"bzr qpull\"  that will be in ui-mode?  Or does one give this with every command to get feedback?\n<OldAl> igc: I will go to the next desktop to try - be back RSN\n<OldAl> igc:   p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }  Run command: bzr \"pull --ui-mode\" bzr: ERROR: unknown command \"pull --ui-mode\"  I see where the *Run command* comes from. It is not really helpful with \"pull\", however.  \"qpull\" maybe?\n<igc> OldAl: yep, --ui-mode is onyl for q* commands\n<OldAl> igc: Well, with wrong data (no reference to where mirror is) the gui gives \"unknown command\".\n<spiv> OldAl: the quotes in  'bzr \"\n<igc> OldAl: let's try again ...\n<OldAl> igc: I still fail to reproduce your \"too verbose\" reply.\n<igc> 1) bzr branch lp:qbzr qbzr\n<igc> 2) cd qbzr\n<igc> 3) bzr qpull --ui-mode\n<spiv> OldAl: the double-quotes in  'bzr \"pull --ui-mode\"'  are odd, I'm not sure why you put them in.  Generally you want to do 'bzr cmd --option', with no quotes.  Quotes change the meaning quite dramatically.\n<OldAl> igc: All from CLI, right?\n<igc> yes\n<igc> OldAl: if you already have a qbzr branch, skip 1\n<OldAl> igc: I only use the \"xxx\" here to show it is an item that was put into GUI.\n<OldAl> igc: No, I don't mind the branch bit - not at all.

One is \"branch,revno\", one is \"branch,revid\" and one is simply \"revid\".\n<MvG> chx: so the question is, if you don't know the branch a revid is supposed to belong to, how to you treat this in trac.\n<bialix> hello all\n<bialix> hello MvG\n<poolie1> hello bialix\n<MvG> Hi there, bialix!\n<bialix> :-)\n<bialix> hello poolie1\n<poolie1> and good night...\n<MvG> 10am here...\n<bialix> poolie1: just yesterday read about five whys: http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/five-whys.html\n<bialix> maybe it could be interested for pilot improvements\n<bialix> and good night\n<bialix> MvG: this channel dancing arounf the world. aussies going to sleep\n<bialix> *around\n<MvG> So I guessed...\n<MvG> Just have to resist the temptation to join in just yet...\n<MvG> ;-)\n<bialix> :-)\n<doctormo> Hey again, I'm re-looking for a way to express the progress of branching and checkout options to a GUI, so far I can either popen the bzr command with a thread and hack together the progress from the stderr output, I'd prefer to use bzrlib, is there any way to do this?\n<poolie1> bialix: yes i think that would be relevant\n<poolie1> we shouldn't just do stuff to work around the current problems, we should dig in to them\n<bialix> agreed, and spiv report make me think this way\n<bialix> glad it maybe useful for you\n<lifeless> doctormo: sure, you can see what bzr-gtk does (uses the API), or qbzr does (wrapps the command line) or bzr-eclipse does (uses the bzr-xmloutput plugin to control it)\n<doctormo> lifeless: Looking at all of those, bzr-gtk doesn't seem to do anything, it's magic.\n<bialix> doctormo: look at qbzr\n<doctormo> bialix: Is wrapping the command line to prefered way of getting progress status?\n<lifeless> doctormo: I'm not sure why you'd say its magic :)\n<doctormo> lifeless: magic == I don't understand it\n<lifeless> doctormo: Not to me; install a ui_factory is what I think is preferred.\n<lifeless> doctormo: but opinions about 'preferred' are, by definition, subjective.\n<bialix> doctormo: no, the point not about wrapping\n<doctormo> lifeless: yes I can tell the ui_factory is involved, it creates by default a TextProgress class\n<bialix> doctormo: there is good example of how to install your ui_factory and how to tie it with GUI\n<lifeless> bialix: oh cool, I'll remember that\n<doctormo> bialix: In qbzr? thanks\n<bialix> lifeless: is it irony?\n<bialix> or sarcasm perhaps\n<lifeless> bialix: neither.\n<bialix> ok, nm\n<doctormo> bialix: lifeless believed that qbzr wrapped the command line output, if I understand, so your correction about it using the ui_factory is interesting.\n<bialix> doctormo: actullay we do both\n<bialix> but for you is relevant ui_factory part\n<bialix> it's just very closer to wrapping command-line\n<bialix> you can omit the latter and use the former as example\n<doctormo> thanks bialix\n<bialix> doctormo: it's in qbzr/lib/subprocess.py\n<doctormo> bialix: I'm going tomake a simple QUIFactory copy, I assume that's involved too\n<bialix> yes, that's correct\n<doctormo> ui.ui_factory = QUIFactory() <- this part I think\n<doctormo> brilliant, got a simple thing up and running.\n<maxb> Does bzr-explorer \"Advanced Commands\" work on Windows?

No clue why that's the case, doesn't seem related to the rest of the commit that introduced it.\n<bialix> weird\n<bialix> MvG: another question: do you think running Trac with built-in server tracd is bad idea?\n<MvG> Should fix this in trunk soon. Do you want to review such a fix?\n<MvG> Depends on the environment.\n<bialix> MvG: I'd like to review, but I need to dive deep enough into the code first\n<bialix> I'm not good hacker re trac-bzr\n<MvG> Apache has some nice features for cleaning up malicious requests, which tracd might miss.\n<bialix> tracd is much easier for me, as dev environmenbt\n<bialix> tracd is much easier for me, as dev environment\n<MvG> Other than that, I always want to embed trac inside a larger page, so I wouldn't use it as a production env.\n<bialix> ok, understand\n<MvG> For development it certainly has benefits, and shouldn't hurt in most cases, unless you want to explicitely test something depending on the frontend.\n<bialix> btw, currently I'm using trac+bzr trunk revno.34 with custom patch applied\n<MvG> What custom patch? SOmething suitable for trunk?\n<bialix> I hope so\n * bialix pastebins\n<bialix> MvG: http://pastebin.com/d29e24ad1\n<bialix> I'm not sure, maybe it already in trunk\n<bialix> I'm stuck with revno 34 and bzrlib 1.5 because later versions does not work well for my case\n<bialix> I have many shared repo and branches on my server\n<MvG> In a modified version: authors = \";\".join(self.revision.get_apparent_authors())\n<bialix> yep, modified version is more correct for newer bzrlib\n<MvG> Multiple shared repos for the same trac env cause trouble.\n<bialix> what kind of trouble?\n<MvG> Well, locking for instance. There seems to be code that only locks the whole repo once.\n<bialix> :-/\n<MvG> Existence of revid checks in some places.\n<bialix> locks locks locks\n<bialix> heh\n<MvG> Both of these I encountered in code that was broken in some other way as well, and which I plan to remove,\n<MvG> So it might coincidentially work with multiple repos as well, but I wouldn't rely on it yet.\n<MvG> There is a whishlist for it, iirc.\n<bialix> For me multiple shared repo is critical feature\n<bialix> we have many components in our project\n<bialix> keep all components in one big shared repo proved to be a *bad* idea\n<eydaimon> is it possible to just merge only the changes of a particular revision, and not changes of some previous revisions? let's say repo A has revision 100, and repo B has revision 98. I want to merge in only changes in revision 100 to B, not 99. Can I merge in, and then at a later time merge the changes for 99? Does that require a special syntax?\n<bialix> (performance) of smart server\n<bialix> eydaimon: bzr merge -c100\n<eydaimon> bialix: and then next time I do bzr merge, then c99 will get merged automatically?\n<bialix> yes\n<eydaimon> thanks\n<bialix> always happy to help\n<chx> MvG: so you are the trac+bzr developer?\n<MvG> chx: I'm the newest member of the trac-bzr-team, i.e. recently got commit permissions on the trac-bzr trunk.\n<MvG> Other than that, I'm mostly busy writing bug fixes for issues I encountered myself, and pushing these for review. Haven't made a single commit to trunk yet.\n<bialix> MvG: re splitting support for 0.10 and 0.11: I'd create new series (say \"0.10\") and use it for 0.10-specific branch\n<eydaimon> is it possible to merge several changes using -c? I tried range, but it said it's not possible\n<MvG> bialix: Dunno... series are usually for feature-stable releases of the component itself, and I'd wish to include as many new features into the 0.10 branch as possible.\n<eydaimon> would I have to merge twice?  (I actually want to merge 386 and 387)\n<bialix> MvG: hm? I think they can be used more flexible\n<eydaimon> or do I have to merge 386 first, commit, then merge 387?\n<bialix> eydaimon: if youo want merge from X to Y you need to use: bzr merge -r (X-1)..Y\n<MvG> eydaimon: bzr merge -r 386..387\n<bialix> -r385..387\n<bialix> -r386..387 is equal to -c387\n<eydaimon> oh, so now the -r syntax as opposed to -c?\n<eydaimon> ok, thanks\n<bialix> eydaimon: -c is syntax sugar\n<bialix> -cN means -r (N-1)..N\n<NfNitLoop> whoah.  didn't reailze 'bzr init' in a svn directory would comlplain that it's already a (svn) branch. :p\n<bialix> NfNitLoop: --no-plugins :-)\n<eydaimon> ok thanks much guys :) appriciate it\n<chx> MvG: sounds awesome\n<chx> MvG: i am about to use trac+bzr :)\n * bialix using trac and trac+bzr 2+ years now and found it very nice tool\n<MvG> chx: Don't hesitate to file any bug you encounter with latest trac-bzr.\n<chx> bialix: really.\n<bialix> Trac has very rich plugins system\n<bialix> on this front it outperform even Redmine\n * bialix heavily using IncludeWiki macros\n<MvG> I find the current state of trac-bzr to be somewhat lacking - which is the reason I'm filing that many bug reports, and writing that many fixes... :-)\n<bialix> given in mind there is not much activity around trac-bzr development...\n<bialix> MvG: today is only barely usable\n<bialix> MvG: what version of Apache do you recommend?\n<MvG> abentley: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~trac-bzr-team/trac-bzr/trunk/revision/28.1.146 indicates that you committed the line which sets self.log = None for trac-bzr. Can you recall your reason for this? I know, it has been 3 years ago, but still worth asking, I guess.\n<MvG> bialix: Using 2.2 myself, and would suggest that to others as well.\n<bialix> MvG: thanks\n<MvG> But my main reason for 2.2 is content negotioation fo static content, so the choice isn't that important for trac.\n<abentley> MvG: Sorry, I don't remember.\n<MvG> abentley: Understandable. Thanks for looking. Will simply remove that line, as it doesn't seem to make sense in current code.\n<matt_pi> Hi. I have a terminology problem. REVISION is a name for the currently commited data, or a name for all the data commited before a certain commit (including this commit).\n<abentley> matt_pi: revision refers to the current state at commit time.  This includes files that were not modified in this commit, but doesn't include old data for files that were modified in this commit.\n<MvG> I just realized that I can't seem to have a lightweight checkout tree of a heavyweight checkout without a tree. Would be useful, though: the lightweight checkout would be my working tree, which i switch from branch to branch as need arises. The heavyweight checkout would be simply a bound branch to ensure that commit and push become atomic, that my trunk will never diverge from upstream trunk unless I explicitely ommit locally.\n<jelmer> mvg: in general you can't have checkouts of checkouts\n<MvG> Is there a good reason for this?\n<matt_pi> abentley: I think I understand. So in a revision are also included other files that werent changed in a commit. In other words: revision is a status of the whole branch, not only a few files.\n<abentley> matt_pi: Yes, but I would say \"whole tree\", not \"whole branch\", because the branch includes all of the past revisions.  \"Snapshot\" vs \"changeset\" is a common distinction.\n<matt_pi> abentley: OK, many thanks.\n<abentley> matt_pi: np\n<stuartpb> How do I set up bzr-git on Windows?\n<stuartpb> How do I set up bzr-git on Windows?\n<stuartpb> How do I set up bzr-git on Windows?\n<LarstiQ> ehm, same as usual?\n * LarstiQ uses neither bzr-git or Windows\n<LarstiQ> stuartpb: are you hitting a snag?\n<stuartpb> well yeah\n<stuartpb> i can't figure out how to install Dulwich for it\n<LarstiQ> ah\n * LarstiQ wonders if there is any C code in Dulwich\n * LarstiQ acquires a copy\n<LarstiQ> stuartpb: yeah, there is C code in there\n<LarstiQ> stuartpb: so if there isn't a binary for Dulwich, you'll need to have a functioning Python-extensions-compilation toolchain\n<chx> i just set up my first bzr server. that was not particularly hard. if i want permissions the easiest is to use bzr+ssh and ssh keys isnt it?\n<LarstiQ> chx: yes\n<LarstiQ> chx: and posix acls\n<chx> (however, the inetd instructions are outdated , seemingly most distributions use xinetd (?). standalone is easy.)\n<RenatoSilva> verterok: hi\n<Peng> beuno: Copyright assignments for Loggerhead? That's new.\n<mwhudson> not really\n<beuno> Peng, it hasn't been as public as it should have been  :)\n<Peng> \"(Last modified 14 May 2009)\" I guess it isn't new... Huh.\n<Peng> I didn't see it on the list last time I looked at that page.\n<Peng> Most of Loggerhead's code is copyrighted by specific people.\n<beuno> Peng, does this create a problem for you?\n<Peng> Or at least...some large portion.\n<Peng> beuno: I dislike copyright assignments, but I'd rather do that than stop contributing.\n<Peng> Or...it's not a copyright assignment? I don't remember. Anyway.\n<beuno> Peng, unfortunetly, laws are complicated\n<beuno> so we've been asked to do this for all Canonical projects\n<Peng> Oh yes, it is a copyright assignment.\n<LarstiQ> can't Canonical invest some money in simplifying laws the world over?\n<beuno> the FSF strongly suggests this approach\n<beuno> LarstiQ, if it was feasible, it would probably be money well spent  ;)\n<beuno> (and hi!)\n<LarstiQ> beuno: yes :)\n<LarstiQ> heya! :)\n<LarstiQ> there are also jurisdictions where you can't sign (all of) your copyright away\n<LarstiQ> ah well\n<Peng> LarstiQ: The agreement covers that.\n<LarstiQ> Peng: ok\n<Peng> I already signed it for Bazaar; should I do it for Loggerhead too?\n<beuno> Peng, I think it's the same\n<Peng> Hmm. The contributor agreement says \"The term 'Software' refers to all computer programs created as part of a Canonical programme listed at http://canonical.com/contributors ...\", so I guess I unintentionally signed it over for everything, not just Bazaar.\n<RenatoSilva> Peng: you'd rather assign copyright than stop contributing. How about the company stoping asking contributors to do that?\n<Peng> RenatoSilva: Oh. Yes, that would be better.\n<RenatoSilva> beuno: FSF suggests what approach, the assignment? For a trustable organization afaik (like themselves)\n<beuno> RenatoSilva, yes. I may be very naive, but I expect Canonical to be trustable\n<beuno> you know, considering they are trusted with basically root access to all Ubuntu users' computers\n<Peng> Haha, that's a good point.\n * Peng is scared of Canonical now\n<beuno> if you don't trust Canonical, you probably have bigger problems than the Copyright assignement\n<luks> beuno: well, I think FSF and Canonical have different reasons for it\n<luks> I'm not sure which reason is better though :)\n<RenatoSilva> beuno: I'm afraid FSF doesn't consider any commercial organization trustable\n<LarstiQ> I'm reasonably sure the FSF has a nuanced stance on that\n<Peng> I suppose I trust Canonical to behave well with their control of my computer, but I do not necessarily believe they'll do what I want with source code.\n<Peng> I already feel funny about how they can and do make it available under other license terms.\n<Peng> It's _probably_ all for a good cause, but _I_ don't know that.\n<Peng> (Well, not necessarily \"and do\". I don't know that.)\n<RenatoSilva> I think the assignment to FSF or related organizations is like \"GPLv2 or later\". You trust FSF is compromized with certain principles and that they won't leave it. So you trust that any later version of GPL is better according to what you believe regarding FOSS. The same way, I think when you disclaim copyright to FSF, you believe that if e.g. they decide switch from GPL to LGPL, that's because they have a good reason.\n<Peng> RenatoSilva: Not everybody does the \"or later\". :D\n<LarstiQ> same thing with Canonical\n<lifeless> Peng: there is only one now; we used to have many seperate ones but consolidated\n<RenatoSilva> Peng: many do afaik. I think the best reason to not assign copyright to a commercial organization is that because of its nature, there's no guarantee that the company will only use the source code for community benefit rather than its own\n<Peng> lifeless: OK. :)\n<lifeless> RenatoSilva: thats like saying 'there are no guarantees'\n<LarstiQ> RenatoSilva: there are no guarantees with FSF either.\n<LarstiQ> RenatoSilva: it comes down to trust, and I trust Canonical with the Bazaar source.\n<Peng> I'm kind of an untrusting person. :\\\n<LarstiQ> whether someone else trusts them with the same thing is up to them.\n<luks> LarstiQ: I've seen many posts on the ML lists that suggested that you can talk to Canonical to get a difference license conditions\n<luks> I haven't seen such posts from FSF on FSF software\n<LarstiQ> luks: so there is a level of trust etc.\n<RenatoSilva> Peng: another good reason is to ask the company a good reason for doing that. That is, why do you want to TAKE my code from me? What's bad about the source code belonging to \"all people in the earth\". It makes difficult to change license? Well, that's reasonable to accept if we're talking about FSF or any non-profit organization, but not for a commercial company.\n<lifeless> RenatoSilva: No one takes the code from you. And updating to newer licences that work better in court as the law changes is a pretty important thing to be able to do.\n<lifeless> or even just to add compatibility with another open source project - like the openssl exception that GPL projects using openssl need.\n<RenatoSilva> LarstiQ: FSF and Canonical have different natures. I trust FSF much more than Canonical. Actually, I would not trust any commercial company that much, or at all.\n<LarstiQ> RenatoSilva: that's your choice, and that's fine.\n<luks> note that I care about the Bazaar agreement much, but this why I'd have trouble signing it\n<luks> I signed a similar agreement for Qt/Nokia, but they were pretty open that they want it because they want to provide a commercial version\n<beuno> luks, do you feel Canonical is not open about it?\n<LarstiQ> luks: right\n<luks> beuno: everybody here is claiminig that it's because they want to keep the code free\n<LarstiQ> beuno: about wanting to offer a commercial version of bzr?\n<beuno> they *will* use it in other scenarios if the situation comes up\n<luks> beuno: but tell me that Canonical doesn't offer a non-GPL version of Bazaar\n<beuno> luks, I am not aware that they do\n<RenatoSilva> lifeless: ok, so why not Canonical disclaims copyright to FSF or some non-profit organization? Because they like to have control and be free to do whatever they want in the future, regardless of that meaning that the actual code authors can't do anything about it\n<lifeless> luks: Canonical does not offer a non-GPL version of Bazaar\n<lifeless> luks: have a look at our website; we offer support and training.\n<luks> lifeless: well, I've seen posts on the bzr ML telling people to talk to Canonical about such posibilities\n<lifeless> luks: http://www.canonical.com/projects/bazaar\n<Peng> The Bazaar website *used* to mention it before the redesign.\n<luks> (posts by Canonical employees)\n<lifeless> Peng: perhaps; nevertheless we've never done it, and its not suggested now AFAIK\n<Peng> lifeless: Interesting.\n<lifeless> RenatoSilva: I don't really follow your logic there. This has been discussed on the mailing list very recently too.\n<Peng> http://web.archive.org/web/20080527233931/http://bazaar-vcs.org/: \"If you want to embed Bazaar into your products under a different license, please contact us.\"\n<Peng> That's what it said.\n<Peng> FYI.\n<RenatoSilva> luks: withy that single copyright, they can embed Bazaar into commercial software at any time, for own benefit or any other reason (and without notifying the community -- I'm afraid the agreement doesn't even cover this). I don't like this idea, and others don't either (hg users seem to not like this aspect of bazaar)\n<lifeless> Peng: yup.\n<lifeless> Peng: To the best of my knowledge it never happened.\n<luks> RenatoSilva: I know why are they doing it :)\n<lifeless> RenatoSilva: I think you mean 'proprietary' rather than 'commercial'\n<Peng> I think this was the third time i started a copyright argument in this channel. :D\n<RenatoSilva> lifeless: yes, as commercial software anre usually proprietary. But what I strictly mean is any derived work that the author would not agree with. For example, I think Bazaar contributors would not like to see their code being distributed as BSD for some customer.\n<RenatoSilva> s/anre/are\n<lifeless> do you really think we'd do that?\n<luks> RenatoSilva: Bazaar contributors always had to assign the copyright to Canonical, even if without a signed agreement, I think they would be fine with it\n<RenatoSilva> the commercial nature is a negative point in that matter. It's the same as saying that you don't trust Chrome binaries, then one says you shouldn't trust FF's either. However, Mozilla foundation is far different from Google, and that makes a big difference in which you trust more (or suspect less)\n<bialix> what's the point?\n<RenatoSilva> luks: I would not be fine. I would not like to see my free time spent for the benefif of all people in a work that now I have no control, and that now is delivered as BSD which may become easily a proprietary software making them (not me) gaining money with my work whose initial intention was to benefit everybody, not someone (and worse, someone *else*).\n<lifeless> RenatoSilva: Even if Canonical went evil and did something like that, the current GPL code would stay GPL, everyone would still be getting the benefit from it.\n<lifeless> but we're not evil - as stewards of Bazaar I think we do pretty well\n<RenatoSilva> lifeless: ok but as we said, we have no control behind the scenes, unless Canonical includes a compromise in the agreement of informing teh world of anything different they do with the contributions, which would make things less interesting commercially, which makes me wonder if they would do such a thing.\n<RenatoSilva> lifeless: I don't know if you are evil :) But just like we say here in my country, we stay with one feet behind :)\n<lifeless> you have no control with any assignment anywhere (even FSF).\n<luks> but the chances of FSF selling your code are pretty thin :)\n<luks> well, \"your\"\n<RenatoSilva> lifeless: but FSF is not Canonical, they're different natures.\n<RenatoSilva> yes, can anyone imagine Stallman in some TV commercial selling \"hey GNU/Hurd for only $99\"\n<LarstiQ> RenatoSilva: yeah, for one thing, Canonical employees actually wrote the vast majority of bzr\n<LarstiQ> and RMS certainly has nothing to do with the Hurd\n<RenatoSilva> maybe Bazaar should be maintained by a non-profit organization with legal commitment to public interests\n<RenatoSilva> about selling the code, that's much more easy to imagine with a commercial company than with that crazzy man\n<chx> I have a technical question. For trac+bzr i would like to point to one place but if that's one branch then it's not possible to check out / commit parts . I would like to get something like an svn repo (and bzr init-repo is not a branch either)\n<chx> how do people use trac+bzr to support multiple branches?\n<mwhudson> lifeless: btw i would be interested what a test for https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~mwhudson/bzr/bytestring-environment-variables/+merge/15113 would look like\n<mwhudson> lifeless: or more particularly i guess, where it would go\n<mwhudson> hm, i guess TestTestCaseWithMemoryTransport\n<bialix> chx: I'm not quite understand your question\n<chx> bialix: nevermind\n<lifeless> mwhudson: seems relevant\n<lifeless> mwhudson: perhaps higher up\n<bialix> chx: ?\n<lifeless> chx: this is one of the problems with trac; its got a _very_ svn specific model.\n<chx> bialix: I now read the trac-bzr README and it says \"Allows a collection of branches to be treated as a \"trac repository\", regardless of whether they are related or in the same bzr repository.\"\n<bialix> luks: evening\n<bialix> chx: yes\n<mwhudson> lifeless: overrideEnvironmentForTesting, the method i'm patching is on TestCaseWithMemoryTransport\n<lifeless> mwhudson: then ttwmt is right\n<lifeless> :)\n<luks> hi bialix\n<chx> I am fine, i am fine, sorry for asking and not RTFMing\n<bialix> luksL how are you?\n<bialix> luks: I have question about lazy_register in qbzr\n<luks> is there a problem with it?\n<bialix> luks: register_lazy_command deliberately don't use plugin_cmds.register_lazy\n<bialix> luks: no, not the problem, I just trying to figure out how to slightly change it\n<luks> I think it should only use plugin_cmds.registry_lazy now\n<bialix> luks: that's my guess as well\n<luks> there was the problem with overwriting commands\n<luks> but I see that's now commented how, so it no longer overwrites merge\n<luks> the custom function was mainly necessary to provide lazy registration before bzrlib supported that\n<bialix> luks: I want to put all lazy commands definitions into big tuple and iterate over it inside one function instead of calling it again and again\n<luks> that seems good\n<luks> I think bzrtools does something like that, right?\n<bialix> luks: yes, we have conflicts with pipeline plugin about overriding merge\n * bialix looks into bzrtools\n<bialix> luks: yes, bzrtools using dict as map between cmd names and aliases\n<luks> ah\n<bialix> I'd prefer keep them as tuples (as it looks now)\n<luks> yep\n<bialix> ok, thx :-)\n<luks> didn't help much :)\n<bialix> well, you said yes two times where I need\n<bialix> this helps\n<bialix> luks: if you still want to get notifications about new revisions in qbzr trunk you may want to subscribe to trunk2a branch\n<mwhudson> lifeless: https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~mwhudson/bzr/bytestring-environment-variables/+merge/15136 has a test now, who can we hassle into being the second reviewer?\n<luks> heh, I've been busy enough last weeks that I didn't even notice :)\n<luks> thanks\n * bialix hopes it was not too much shameless\n<luks> heh, I see jelmer is also working on bzr-hg\n<luks> I wonder in what state it is\n<mwhudson> luks: it'll probably a code import option on lp in a couple of months\n<mwhudson> maybe even in december i guess\n<luks> cool\n<luks> do you think dpush works/will work soon?\n<mwhudson> i don't know, but would guess on \"soon\" if it doesn't work yet\n<luks> I need to try it out\n<luks> I really don't get what people like about hg\n<luks> I've tried hard to work with it, but I find my way around it\n<luks> +can't\n<luks> speaking of the devil :)\n<luks> hi jelmer\n<meoblast001> hi\n<meoblast001> i set up a bzr repository on my system, how can i make it public?\n<meoblast001> it uses SSH\n<lifeless> mwhudson: Do you have commit access yet?\n<bialix> luks: I don't know why, but I can't force myself to use hg longer then 15 minutes\n<mwhudson> lifeless: no\n<luks> bialix: I have hard time understanding how they work with multiple branches\n<lifeless> poolie: ^ mwhudson for commit access?\n<luks> bialix: it seems multiple clones is the way to go, which is just weird\n<jelmer> hey luks\n<bialix> meoblast001: serve it via http perhaps?\n<luks> jelmer: I was wondering, does dpush work in bzr-hg?\n<meoblast001> hm :/\n<jelmer> luks, no, not yet\n<meoblast001> so just put the repository in /var/www?\n<meoblast001> or make a symlink to the directory?

The advantage of bzr+ssh = speed/encryption and the advantage of bzr+http(s) = encryption/flexible user management, correct? I'm thinking about setting up bzr+http (ro) and bzr+https (rw) and connect apache to a small db (test) or ldap (production) instead of using bzr+ssh and just would like a small piece of advice _before_ I start setting it up.\n<lifeless> SWAT: the smart server can work over http\n<lifeless> SWAT: so you've presented a false dichotomy ;)\n<maxb> lifeless: The problem with the feature as currently implemented is that it discards revisions solely based on ancestry. What it should/could do, to be correct, is discard revisions only if a merge results in there being no changes to commit.\n<lifeless> maxb: perhaps\n<lifeless> maxb: though I don't think I agree\n<maxb> You don't think that it's wrong that rebase is lossy by default?\n<lifeless> rebase is by definition lossy\n<lifeless> its its raison d'etre\n<maxb> Well... far more lossy than the basic concept of rebasing inherently includes\n<lifeless> anyhow, a merge that includes something from the branch being rebased *on* should be discarded.\n<lifeless> whether or not there are textual changes is perhaps a case for a warning.\n<maxb> Yes.... but only if there aren't relevant textual changes remaining on merging it\n<lifeless> maybe\n<lifeless> I think it really depends on the exact change\n<lifeless> and what it means semantically.\n<SWAT> lifeless: ah, right, thanks. Let me put it differently: is it adviseable to use bzr+http(s) instead of bzr+ssh or is it all neglectable?\n<lifeless> maxb: it probably needs to be put way down at the bottom of the rebase in fact, for the case of a merge already in the base.\n<lifeless> maxb: OTOH a merge from a branch not merged to base, should be kept.\n<lifeless> SWAT: shouldn't be any significant differences in performance.\n<lifeless> SWAT: if there are, they are bugs\n<SWAT> lifeless: thanks a lot. I'll leave you to your other discussion(s). Cheers\n<maxb> I don't think it makes sense to try to replay merges out-of-order if that's what you're suggesting - the merge is on top of other changes on your branch being rebased, and is likely to have textual dependencies on them\n<lifeless> maxb: I'm not sure I was totally clear about the case being discussed\n<maxb> Well, I'm approaching this from the PoV of \"It's never OK to discard a merge revision purely based on ancestry, you have to see if there are relevant textual changes\" - because the act of resolving conflicts when the merge was done may include making valuable changes.\n<maxb> By way of a specific example: we had a Launchpad branch for a newer python version. When a new script was added on trunk, the shebang had to be changed as part of merging the addition to the branch.\n<maxb> A purely ancestry-based approach would silently lose that sort of change\n<lifeless> maxb: but thats my example\n<maxb> ?\n<lifeless> maxb: if you have the rev merged earlier you need the shebang earlier too\n<maxb> hmm. The idea of reordering changesets instead of just replaying the graph maintaining its shape is scary\n<lifeless> maxb: rebasing anything where revisions merged higher up that are already in the new base is non trivial.\n<lifeless> maxb: (consider the typical loom usecase)\n<lifeless> maxb: where what you are rebasing is just a non-linear but still discrete subgraph, its easy.\n<lifeless> this is one of the problems with merges and rebase.\n<lifeless> spiv: can I beg you to fix pqm-submit today? It would save me reinventing yoour changes.\n<spiv> lifeless: ok\n<spiv> lifeless: although I would hope you'd choose to build on my changes, rather than reinvent them...\n<lifeless> spiv: So would I.\n<eric_f> lifeless: thanks for the tip on: for dir in `ls $1`; I got it working, but can't get it to work as a Bash alias. Any ideas?\n<lifeless> eric_f: I'd make a small bash script\n<lifeless> you might also look at 'bzr-removable', it might fit your needs (if I'm guessing right)\n<Peng> Wow. \"bzr check\" on a 1.14 copy of MySQL is using more than 4 gigs of RAM.\n<eric_f> lifeless: I'm doing this:\n<eric_f> for dir in `ls $1`; do if [ -e ${dir}/.bzr ]; then echo ${dir}; echo --------------------; bzr status ${dir}; echo; fi done;\n<spiv> Peng: it checks your RAM *and* your branch!\n<eric_f> i want to alias that so I don't have to type it all the time\n<lifeless> eric_f: put it in a script in your path\n<lifeless> then you don't have to type it all the time\n<Peng> spiv: It's checking my swap, too.\n<lifeless> mem\n<lifeless> disk\n<lifeless> content\n<lifeless> \\o/\n<lifeless> profit\n<Peng> But I don't want to pay for more RAM.\n<Peng> This is really amazing, though.

Maybe 500-600 MB of RAM.\n<Peng> 2a rocks.\n<Peng> How did we ever live with the pre-2a formats? :P\n<Linkadmin> is there any way in a central repository setup to have the repository automatically update its tree on commit? the push-and-update plugin looks like a local hook, and the automirror plugin seems to only want to push to a second repo\n<Peng> Currently RAM+swap is approaching 7 GB.\n<fullermd> Peng: Machines get more memory all the time.  If we don't keep up with that increase, how will we ever compete with Windows?\n<Peng> Can Canonical send me $70 so I can buy enough RAM to check this repo? :D\n<Peng> Actually, only $50. I have a little money in my wallet. :P\n<fullermd> Shoulda bought memory back in June like I did, before it shot back up in price   :p\n<lifeless> Linkadmin: not really.\n<lifeless> Linkadmin: generally that suggests you are trying to do something in an unusual way\n<Linkadmin> i just want the working tree to be updated when i do a commit...\n<Peng> Linkadmin: Why does the central repo need a tree at all?\n<Linkadmin> Peng: sorry, i meant the branch needs a working copy\n<Linkadmin> not the repo\n<Peng> Linkadmin: Why does the central branch need a tree?\n<Linkadmin> Peng: because i'd like to set up a webserver to point to the docs I'm keeping in version control\n<Linkadmin> so if i do i.e., bzr init-repo repo ; bzr init repo/branch and then remotely commit to repo/branch, i don't seem to see my updated docs in repo/branches on the server\n<Peng> Oooh.\n<Linkadmin> and when I do bzr push, it tells me something about the remote tree not being updated  :S\n<spiv> Linkadmin: working trees are designed for local use, bzr can't update them over remote connections like sftp\n<spiv> Linkadmin: you may be interested in the bzr-upload or bzr-push-and-update plugins\n<Linkadmin> spiv: yeah i was looking at that, but those seem to be local hooks, not run on the central repository\n<spiv> Right.\n<Linkadmin> which means that the plugins need to be installed on every collaborator's computer, and they all need to use the plugins' commands\n<spiv> Well, push-and-update hooks into regular bzr push, but yes.\n<spiv> The simplest solution is to put a cron job on the server that runs \"bzr update\" every 10 minutes or so.\n<Linkadmin> i think i'll probably set up a second branch and have automirror push to that branch. Since automirror is post_commit, that means it's run from the central repo, right?\n<spiv> If the central branch is only written to via a smart server (e.g. bzr+ssh), then in principle you could write a simple plugin to hook the Branch.post_branch_tip_change event and then run \"bzr update\" from that.\n<spiv> But I wouldn't be surprised if there are a bunch of annoying details that make that harder than it should be...\n<Linkadmin> i was thinking about doing that too yeah\n<spiv> I'd be happy to help if you want to do that, though.\n<Linkadmin> but it sounds like automirror would be a safer choice if it can run on commit on the repo, and not on individual systems\n<spiv> post_commit is run where the commit happens -- i.e. the computer where 'bzr commit' is running, not on the repo.\n<Linkadmin> oh man\n<spiv> The right server-side hook is Branch.post_change_branch_tip\n<Linkadmin> but wait...\n<Linkadmin> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-email/+bug/307988\n<ubottu> Launchpad bug 307988 in bzr-email \"Central repository email?\" [Undecided,Invalid]\n<Linkadmin> this runs from the central server\n<Linkadmin> oh i see\n<Linkadmin> different hooks, ok\n<spiv> Yes, bzr-email uses that hook\n<Linkadmin> do you know if automirror does? I'll go look for the code, brb\n<spiv> (Although it will fallback to post_commit for ancient bzr versions)\n<spiv> It appears not, but it's probably not hard to update it.\n<spiv> Linkadmin: give me 10 minutes, I'll whip up a patch, this looks pretty straightforward\n<Linkadmin> w00t w00t\n<spiv> Linkadmin: lp:~spiv/bzr-automirror/use-new-hook\n<Linkadmin> i was just looking at that  :)\n<Linkadmin> i'll try it out right now\n<Linkadmin> just to recap my plan, i'll bzr init-repo repo ; bzr init repo/branch1 ; bzr init repo/branch2, then in branch1/.bzr/branch/branch.conf i'll tell it to post_commit_update (or whatever the setting is) to branch2, and when I commit over bzr+ssh remotely, that hook will run properly?\n<lifeless> sure. Dunno why you need a second branch thouh.\n<Linkadmin> well because i don't think automirror will properly push the branch into its own working copy without problems, right?\n<lifeless> uh\n<lifeless> so I would just call tree.update() from the post tip change hook on the server\n<spiv> lifeless: the \"just\" there hides a few details, but sure :)\n<spiv> I guess params.branch.bzrdir.open_workingtree().update() would probably work.\n<Linkadmin> then why doesn't bzr do that by default? It does it for local branches but won't do it on remotes...\n<lifeless> with try: except errors.NoWorkingTree:pass\n<lifeless> Linkadmin: because in the general case it won't work.\n<lifeless> Linkadmin: if you have conflicts, or the tree is locally edited, there is no UI for the person pushing to fix issues with it.\n<Linkadmin> gotcha\n<spiv> And we'd need to define the network protocol for reporting those issues, etc.\n<Linkadmin> makes sense\n<Linkadmin> so it will probably come at some point i guess\n<spiv> In your case, you're always expecting tree.update() to work because there should never be any local changes.\n<lifeless> Linkadmin: I doubt it.\n<lifeless> Linkadmin: its not on anyones todo list, and I know of plenty of cases where doing it would be very much the wrong think.\n<Linkadmin> is there a roadmap for features for future development?\n<lifeless> s/think/thing/\n<poolie> lifeless: as part of patch piloting, please chase up contributor agreements where needed\n<poolie> and add them to that team\n<mwhudson> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/326532/ <- is that ok for NEWS entry?\n<Linkadmin> thx a ton for the help guys.

I'll wait till weekend if you find the time for review.\n<OldAl> igc: Just had a chat with bialix.\n<bialix> MvG: revision key? maybe revision-id?\n<MvG> bialix: No. The one-element tuple (revid,) seems to be /one/ possible form of a revision key, but I assume not the only one.\n * MvG is reading Repository.get_parent_map\n<bialix> where isone-item tuple, there is possible multiple-items tuples\n<MvG> yes, but with what meaning?\n<bialix> direct meaning\n<bialix> get several revisions from repo\n<bialix> in a batch\n<OldAl> igc: I've downloaded the docs about bzr-plugins from your lp +/junk address, did  make html, got the result in _html directory (I think).  Lots of complaints from Sphinx about missing parts.\n<MvG> I doubt it's treated as a list, because get_parent_map even deals with lists of revision keys.\n<OldAl> igc: Do you expect the documenters to know Sphinx?

Please could you log a bug so that it does not slip through the cracks.\n<asabil> GaryvdM, yeah sure, I will do that later\n<asabil> thanks for your help\n<bialix> MvG: what do you mean?\n<GaryvdM> Pleasure\n<MvG> bialix: http://starship.python.net/crew/mwh/bzrlibapi/bzrlib.inventory.InventoryDirectory.html e.g. doesn't list \"parent_id\", the one I mentioned in my question above. pydoc does.\n<bialix> MvG: I'm sure mwhudson is master of that doc\n<bialix> MvG: ah, hmm, there is used custom tool for building these docs, called pydoctor IIRC\n<MvG> I see.\n<MvG> thx.\n<MvG> Don't feel like filing a feature request for such tools just now.\n<bialix> the doc generated automatically, so if there is nothing than most likely either original sources lacking it or bug in pydoctor\n<bialix> you may want ask mwhudson\n<MvG> The members are undocumented.\n<bialix> that's bad, sorry, I can't help here\n<MvG> His name has been mentioned often enough, I guess if he's available and feels like answering, he will.\n<bialix> he's from land of kiwi IIRC, so right now he's sleeping\n<MvG> Maybe will read logs...\n * jelmer hugs jam\n<jelmer> meliae ftw\n<jelmer> oh, also\n * jelmer hugs mwhudson\n<MvG> mzz: Do you wish to review https://code.launchpad.net/~gagern/trac-bzr/bug484983/+merge/15199 regarding the removal of the get_previous method we talked about the other day?\n<mzz> MvG: did you check that the generated history for the root node is at least as sensible compared to the history for a subdirectory as it was before?\n<MvG> jelmer: as you write such an encouraging comment about having bzrlib deal with dotted revnos, would you have a look at https://code.launchpad.net/~gagern/trac-bzr/bug487529/+merge/15201 and comment?\n<MvG> mzz: Yes.\n<MvG> mzz: Root of the branch you mean, right?\n<MvG> It's way more sensible now.\n<MvG> At least in the cases I encountered.\n<mzz> MvG: yes (which was supposed to be returning all ancestry unconditionally both now and before)\n<mzz> I'm just a little worried about there being off by ones in one if you're fixing them in the other\n<mzz> but if you've tested them that's definitely good enough for me.,\n<MvG> mzz: All ancestry up top the current rev. It returned all ancestry up to the tip of the branch before.\n<jelmer> MvG, you probably want to catch ValueError as well in revid_from_dotted\n<jelmer> MvG: and return None\n<MvG> jelmer: Would happen if the tuple has an invalid number of elements?\n<jelmer> MvG: if there are non-integers in the string\n<MvG> jelmer: The caller ensures that for now. If it doesn't, I guess I'd rather consider that an error on the part of the caller.\n<MvG> Of course, I could as well drop the check for the caller...\n<jelmer> MvG: ah, never mind then\n<jelmer> also, any particular reason for assigning a variable and returning that rather than returning directly?\n<jelmer> seems fine otherwise\n<MvG> jelmer: Easier to insert a debug statement in between, or some further processing step.\n<MvG> mzz: Thanks for the review!\n<mzz> sure, but it really doesn't mean much since I really have not looked at this code in ages\n<mzz> this is more like me getting the impression you know at least as much about what's going on than I did when I wrote all this than me understanding the changes\n<Morbus> i don't suppose anyone uses trac-bzr in here?\n<MvG> mzz: and that I made no obvious flaws, or recreated errors you did back then and still remember.\n<jelmer> Morbus: we were just talking about it :-)\n<MvG> :-D\n<Morbus> oh great. i have a newb support question! ;)\n<Morbus> heh, heh\n<MvG> Let's hear it.\n<jelmer> mvg: Anyway, the changes seem fine in general\n<Morbus> just grabbed the latest lp main, made an egg of it, installed it into local Trac, and made the changes per the README directory.\n<Morbus> my repo directory is set to [11:42]  <Morbus> repository_dir = /ebs/repositories/bzr\n<Morbus> which contains a single branch - but eventually with more.\n<Morbus> when i head to trac/browser, i receive:\n<Morbus> NoRepositoryPresent: No repository present: \"file:///ebs/repositories/bzr/examiner-d7/\"\n<Morbus> so, it's seeing the (only) branch there, but not getting much further.\n<MvG> jelmer: I'm just debugging a strange incident where a dotted revno won't get accepted as a revision.

The way it works is that there is an upper bound.\n<lifeless> and when the bound is exceeded by a transaction, an incremental pack is triggered, which consolidates the smallest (by rev count) packs into one, stopping at the point that will be under the upper bound.\n<lifeless> mwhudson: the upper bound is sum(int(digit) for digit in str(repo.revision_count()))\n<mathiaz> Hi - Is there  a way to find the revno of the common ancestor for two branches?\n<mwhudson> lifeless: right, that's what i thought\n<lifeless> mwhudson: so 998 revisons == 26 as upper bound\n<mwhudson> i guess i was too lazy to work out what that is for launchpad :)\n<lifeless> and in general, upper bound ~= 10*log10(revcount)\n<lifeless> mathiaz: not really, no. there is show-ancestor I think.\n<mathiaz> lifeless: ok found a workaround for ubuntu package branches\n<mathiaz> lifeless: bzr log -rancestor:../squeeze (in the lucid branch)\n<mathiaz> lifeless: ^^ that gives the revno of the common ancestor\n<_habnabit> Is it possible to only merge part of a revision, without merging the whole revision?\n<Peng> I suppose you can shelve or revert some of the changes.\n<Peng> History-wise, you can either record that the revision was merged or not (a cherrypick).\n<_habnabit> So, merge that revision, shelve the changes, and commit?\n<Peng> If you want to.\n<Peng> What are you trying to do?\n<spiv> _habnabit: yes, that works.  But if that records as a merge, it means future merges will not try to merge the bits you left out.\n<_habnabit> I'm trying to backport changes from a fork of a particular project, but one revision has some changes I don't want to backport.\n<spiv> Which may be what you want?\n<spiv> Ok, my guess is that is what you want, then :)\n<_habnabit> I'm not sure what the exact connotations of what you said are, so.\n<spiv> Well, after you 'bzr merge' but before you 'bzr commit', look at 'bzr status'; it (usually) will show \"pending merges\"\n<jam> igc: not critical at all, just genuine. I haven't had time because of X and Y and Z, and if someone else *has* the time, I'm really far behind\n<jam> and it would be great\n<jam> its a fair amount of work to announce\n<jam> and I didn't open my laptop really until this evening for a little bit\n<spiv> _habnabit: commit records the contents of the files, but it can also record \"revision X was merged in at this point\".  If it does, then the next time you 'bzr merge' in that branch bzr will know that the changes in that revision have already been merged and will not merge them again.\n<_habnabit> spiv, ah.\n<_habnabit> I did the merge, but it doesn't show that there are any pending merges.\n<spiv> _habnabit: so the question is basically, \"the next time you merge from that branch into this one, do you want bzr to try merge all these changes again, or assume they have been merged (so only newer changes should be considered)\"\n<_habnabit> There were conflicts, though.\n<_habnabit> (And I resolved the conflicts.)\n<spiv> Conflicts don't affect that; but if you do 'bzr merge -r X..Y' or 'bzr merge subdirectory/of/branch' or something like that, it won't record a pending merge in the working tree.\n<_habnabit> Ahh, I see.\n<_habnabit> Yeah, I did merge -r.\n<spiv> Because the merge record is just \"this revision ID is another parent of this revision\"\n<spiv> Which can't track revision ranges or merging just some files, etc.\n<spiv> We'd like to track these more complicated cases, but we haven't implemented that yet.\n<lifeless> poolie: http://amp.carboni.ca/\n<mwhudson> wow, that sounds fairly insane\n<Peng> Rewriting Bazaar? That's not going to be fun.\n<mkanat> That sounds like a general waste of time, in fact.\n<LaserJock> is there an equivalent to git gc in bzr?\n<Peng> LaserJock: Removing unreferenced revisions? No.\n<Peng> LaserJock: Recompressing the repository? \"bzr pack\". But, a side from a couple old bugs leading to bad compression, you don't need to run it yourslf; bzr autopacks frequently enough to keep things healthy.\n<Peng> s/a side/aside/\n<Peng> s/yourslf/yourself/ damn.\n<Peng> (Actually, the bugs aren't that old, but they weren't frequently hit: you would have to have been using the 2a format before bzr 2.0.)\n<Peng> LaserJock: BTW, unless you'r using the 2a format, \"bzr pack\" doesn't even do all that much: it combines the pack files into 1, bit it doesn't recompress them.\n<Peng> s/bit/but/ What's wrong with my typing tonight?\n<LaserJock> Peng: but there's the obsolete-packs dir, right. Does bzr pack get rid of that?\n<LaserJock> I was just comparing .git to .bzr sizes on a branch and I noticed that .bzr was huge\n<mwhudson> LaserJock: no, obsolete-packs is probably still there\n<LaserJock> ok, well I just rm'd the contents of obsolete-packs\n<Peng> LaserJock: Every time the repo is packed (whether an auto-pack or \"bzr pack\"), obsolete_packs is emptied, then afterwards, any now-unnecessary packs are moved into it.\n<Peng> LaserJock: Why?\n<LaserJock> Peng: ok, that doesn't make a ton of sense to me but I believe you\n<LaserJock> because I don't know how to get rid of it otherwise\n<Peng> LaserJock: It'll be automatically emptied later. Why do you need to do it now?\n<LaserJock> 1) because i'm trying to figure out repo sizes\n<LaserJock> 2) I don't know when it will be emptied\n<LaserJock> it was an extra 100+MB sitting in my branch\n<Peng> LaserJock: obsolete_packs is used because OSes can't be trusted to immediately write files to the disk. It'd be unfortunate if you had a power failure right after a \"bzr pack\" and lost all of your data because the file was really sitting in a buffer. This way, you still have the old packs around to recover.\n<LaserJock> having almost 200MB for a 20MB working tree doesn't seem very space-efficient to me\n<Peng> LaserJock: Which repo format? (\"bzr info\")\n<LaserJock> 2a\n<Peng> Aww.\n<mwhudson> what does bzr thing about \\r in commit messages these days?\n<LaserJock> if you tell me I need a newer format I'm going to kill myself\n<Peng> LaserJock: Sadly, there isn't another new format yet. :P\n<LaserJock> how can this be?!\n<LaserJock> I thought the 2.0 format was supposed to get much closer to git with respect to size\n<Peng> It usually does.\n<mwhudson> LaserJock: how big is git for this branch?\n<LaserJock> mwhudson: 22MB\n<LaserJock> bzr is 45MB after rm'ing the obsolete packs\n<LaserJock> most of the branches I've tried bzr seems to run around twice the size\n<mwhudson> LaserJock: converted with bzr-git?\n<LaserJock> on that one yeah\n<LaserJock> other's have been git-svn vs bzr-svn\n<LaserJock> *others\n<Peng> mwhudson: Wasn't bzr recently changed to remove \\r from commit messages, at least on Windows and/or at least in XML-based repos?\n<mwhudson> Peng: doesn't look like it\n<mwhudson> Peng: bzrlib.repository.CommitBuilder._validate_unicode_text\n<Peng> mwhudson: r4783\n<Peng> mwhudson: It's only done at a high level, when you use \"bzr ci -m\".\n<Peng> mwhudson: Other than that, I've got no idea what the \\r situation is. :D\n<igc> LaserJock: try converting with git fast-export + bzr fast-import instead. I think you'll see a smaller size\n<igc> LaserJock: than conversion via bzr-git gives you\n<LaserJock> interesting\n<mwhudson> the revids will me much shorter :-)\n<mwhudson> *be\n<LaserJock> 22MB vs 45MB isn't too bad, I just thought 22MB vs 200MB was a bit excessive\n<igc> LaserJock: Bzr's compression is sensitive to the rev-id and file-id scheme used. fast-import uses the native bzr schemes while bzr-git uses a custom scheme\n<igc> ditto for bzr-hg and bzr-svn\n<LaserJock> I see\n<vila> hi all\n<poolie> hello vila\n<poolie> hello vila\n<vila> hey poolie !

Will certainly serve me a lot of worries.\n<bialix> those who used trac-bzr already used to use trunk\n<bialix> (how's bad I said :-/)\n<jml> mwhudson, I might have changed the owner way back when\n<jml> mwhudson, a more interesting question to me is, \"why does it apparently retry and then still fail with an error message referring to the old branch location\"\n<mwhudson> jml: yeah, that's a bit odd\n * jml drinks something awesome that rhymes with \"banoffee\"\n<jml> mwhudson, I'm torn between investigating it, and not.\n<poolie> hi jml\n<mwhudson> jml: https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~vcs-imports/emacs/trunk seems happier now\n<mwhudson> not happy\n<mwhudson> just happier\n<jml> mwhudson, looks happyish\n<mwhudson> let's leave it for 6 hours and see what happens :-)\n<mwhudson> or kill it and start again\n<jml> mwhudson, the dates on the 'recent revision' thing seem a little off :)\n<mwhudson> yeah\n<jml> (weird, years used to begin with a 1 and no one cared)\n<jml> poolie, hi\n<mwhudson> jml: loggerhead seems to have a more plausible idea of the revisions\n<mwhudson> i wonder if it's choking the scanner\n<jml> poolie, fwiw, I think that food prepared from _Lobscouse and Spotted Dog_ makes more sense over here.\n<jml> mwhudson, I'll bet its choking the scanner.\n<jml> it's\n<poolie> jml, i bet\n<lifeless> poolie: re: devscripts, not offhand, let me have a look\n<poolie> nm\n<poolie> i'm sending a mail summarizing where i got up to\n<lifeless> anyhow, I'd be using schroot fwiw\n<jml> lp devscripts?\n * bialix hates to get random errors in the tests with sftp testing server like this: PermissionDenied: Permission denied: \"lock/held\": [Errno 13] Permission denied\n<kostja_osipov> Hello\n<kostja_osipov> could somebody help me with bzr gannotate?\n<kostja_osipov> what I actually need is to find out the revision id of a changeset that deletes lines\n<kostja_osipov> since the lines are not in annotate output, I can't find the revision\n<kostja_osipov> what is the procedure for that in bzr?\n<bialix> I'm doubt there is simple way to find deleted lines\n<bialix> they are deleted\n<bialix> maybe hgrep plugin will help?\n<bialix> or log -p?\n<kostja_osipov> oh well... there of course is. you scroll back in the revision history, till you find the changeset that still has the lines\n<kostja_osipov> the next changeset removes them\n<kostja_osipov> but it can be quite tedious\n<bialix> I won't call this way \"simple\"\n<kostja_osipov> would be nice if I could see all revisions in a file  on a time line so that I could do binary search on it\n<bialix> you're need weave representation it seems\n<bialix> you may want to ask jam when he'll be here\n<vila> kostja_osipov: bzr qannotate provides the per-file graph, i.e. displays all the revisions that modify a file one way or another\n<lifeless> gnight\n<bialix> vila: it's not quite true: this graph is sorted and represents only revisions which modified lines in currently annotated version. but if you go back in history and annotate older versions you'll get more graph\n<bialix> bonjour vila, btw :-)\n<vila> bialix: hi !\n<vila> bialix: you're right, I keep forgetting the difference :-(\n<vila> bialix: I should really talk to garry about *not* using that graph but presenting the real per-file graph instead, I'm pretty sure the performance penalty will be lost in the noise\n<bialix> vila: sometimes I have the same needs as kostja_osipov, I'm still not found easy way to bisect this\n<bialix> vila: you can, but actually this feature done not from performance point of view\n<bialix> I guess it's intended\n<bialix> but as we see, sometimes this approach has flaws\n<bialix> file a bug!\n<bialix> please\n<jml> hello\n<stanman246> lol\n<stanman246> sometimes i work on a project with someone else. Now i'd like to do some kind of version control, he's been looking into bzr already.\n<stanman246> It's a webbased project (cakephp) and we're working on the same files every now and then, can this be controlled with bzr?\n<jml> yes\n<jml> in a variety of ways\n<stanman246> ok, will need to go into some tuts i guess\n<jml> probably.\n<jml> stanman246, have you used a version control tool before?\n<stanman246> no\n<jml> stanman246, the big difference from just editing files is that rather than just hitting \"save\", you can group changes together in a single \"commit\", which generally also has a short description of the change\n<stanman246> come across Git, hows that?\n<jml> stanman246, roughly speaking it has feature parity with Bazaar. I find it's UI more complex and less helpful.\n<stanman246> jml: yes, so i saw\n<stanman246> ah\n<stanman246> but... bzr is working with .bzr folders locally right?\n<jml> stanman246, yes, kind of, but that seems an odd question to ask.\n<stanman246> really need to tut first, before asking, sry\n<jml> stanman246, are you and your colleague editing PHP files on the web server itself?\n<stanman246> not at first\n<jml> stanman246, ok.\n<jml> that's good :)\n<stanman246> we used to use winscp to get the files, edit them and then up them\n<stanman246> but with bzr we could edit the files on the server right?\n<stanman246> I don't feel really comfy with that thos\n<jml> it's not a good way of doing things.\n<jml> VCS makes it slightly easier to separate changing the code from doing a release, IMO.\n<jml> and changing files onto the webserver in the web area is basically doing a release\n<jml> anyway, here's what I'd do to start with:\n<jml> make a copy of your code.\n<stanman246> local\n<stanman246> right\n<stanman246> ?\n<jml> for now, anywhere.\n<jml> just make sure you have a copy in case everything goes horribly wrong\n<jml> but also have a copy that you can change into and run 'bzr init' then 'bzr add' and then 'bzr commit'\n<jml> this makes a branch that you can play with\n<jml> if you put that branch onto the server (either by copying it or running 'bzr push' or something) then you can either check it out ('bzr checkout') or branch it ('bzr branch')\n<kostja_osipov> vila: thanks, I actually used bzr log -p and was able to dig up the changeset i need\n<vila> kostja_osipov: cool, did you succeed with your cherry-picks yesterday ?\n<kostja_osipov> vila: i'm still in progress.\n<kostja_osipov> I am reapplying the first patch in a series, and it touches 40 files and each file has conflicts.\n<kostja_osipov> our problem yesterday was a bit of a bit larger puzzle :)\n<vila> hmm, so you're back to doing the *first* merge without using patch -p0 ?\n<yuval> hey all, I'm seeing the error \"not installing http[s]+webdav:// support (only supported for bzr 1.12 and above)\" on every command i run. any ideas why this is happening and how to fix? running bzr 2.0.0\n<marek_> hi i have a question\n<marek_> i have two repos one or locally connected server\n<marek_> and other on my local host\n<bialix> maxb: ping\n<maxb> pong\n<bialix> maxb: do you remember your patch for qlog to preserve leading spaces?\n<maxb> yes\n<marek_> and the problem is:\n<bialix> does it still work for you with latest qbzr trunk?\n<marek_> i first branched from server to my localhost\n<marek_> than edited few files\n<marek_> then comited locally\n<bialix> maxb: when I've merged your patch I've added the test.

Won't bother you with this in the future.\n<bialix> maxb: I found the root of problem, but the fix is not so trivial...\n<bialix> maxb: fixed and pushed to trunk2a. testing are welcome\n<stanman246> hi, i've got ubuntu 9.04 running and installed bzr\n<stanman246> but the version is 1.13.1 and my colleague has the repository set up on v 2.0, can i upgrade my bzr version?\n<vila> stanman246: you can use the bzr PPA\n<maxb> stanman246: There is a bzr PPA that carries the latest released version of bzr, bzrtools and a few other things\n<vila> stanman246: https://launchpad.net/~bzr/+archive\n<vila> stanman246: or you can upgrade to 9.10 :)\n<stanman246> haha\n<stanman246> thinking of that...\n<chx> hey, 9.10 is awesome\n<vila> the later is a couple of clicks away while the former requires a bit more work :)\n<chx> it drives my T400s just fine\n<chx> I think the only feature of the laptop that does not work is the \"silence the mic\" button\n<chx> but i bet i could make that work too if i would care :)\n<stanman246> hmm... on my hp 6720s 9.10 didn't work with compiz..\n<stanman246> just did the ppa upgrade to 2.0.2!\n<stanman246> ok, now i'm gonna read some!

Surely your Makefile (or whatever) knows how to mkdir bin\n<brmassa> AfC: my question was more like the common practice than a howto. what people normally do.\n<AfC> brmassa: right. So version control Makefile.\n<AfC> brmassa: ah. Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but in the GNOME world we don't version control build artifacts.\n<brmassa> AfC: hmmm not even the directory structure needed to build a given app?\n<AfC> brmassa: there is a *horrible* tendency in the Windows centric side of the Java world to whack .jar files the project depends on into version control\n<AfC> (partly because they don't have a proper package management system they can query & reply on, and partly because they're just doing the wrong thing out of sheer bloody mindedness :)\n<AfC> brmassa: sure, you can do that, but why not have your Makefile (or whatever) mkdir your temporary & output structure for you?\n<lifeless> brmassa: if you need a directory structure, and your toolchain doesn't create it automatically, versioning the structure would be a good idea.\n<lifeless> brmassa: what toolchain are you using ?\n<AfC> [thereby making it just the sort of thing that can be a) `bzr ignore`d and b) `make {dist,}clean`ed\n<AfC> brmassa: other than that, listen to lifeless :)\n<Peng> If you have to version e.g. bin, you could still \"bzr ignore bin/*\".\n<AfC> brmassa: [as indeed this isn't the place to talk about comparative merits of different toolchain strategies; bzr can do what you're asking if that's the way you wish to do it]\n<brmassa> lifeless: im programming using Qt's qmake. well.... it does create directories if i tell so, but i was wondering to just track the myproject/src dir...\n<AfC> Oh, there's a gem: on #cairo, \"git has erased all history of that merge\"\n<lifeless> brmassa: you should track the things that are both: things other people will need to build the software AND things they can't get elsewhere\n<brmassa> lifeless: hmmm nicely put\n<lifeless> directories that the toolchain can make for you aren't in that set, IMO :)\n<AfC> lifeless: that _was_ nicely put\n * AfC takes a quote of that, and then wonders how to properly cite an IRC discussion in a footnote :)\n<brmassa> its because i use a specific dir structure on all my projects, like myproject/src, myproject/includes, myproject/bin, myproject/tests, myproject/media, so i was wondering to just version the part of it instead the whole structure...\n<brmassa> but for new developers, who wil download the bzr tree, it might help to just see the BIN dir...\n<AfC> brmassa: {shrug} they will after they type `make` :)\n<brmassa> AfC: yep. maybe u r right.\n<AfC> brmassa: in most projects I'm maintainer of, things are structured so that with the exception of a Makefile fragment called .config created by our [custom] top level ./configure,\n<AfC> brmassa: *all* the build output runs out into directories under a top level tmp/ that the build creates for itself\n<brmassa> AfC: nice. it seems to be the right thing to do. well thank all you guys.\n<AfC> brmassa: [with one further exception that there's an entire source tree created during the first step of the build, and so the build mkdir's a tree called generated/ for that]\n<AfC> brmassa: [but in this case generated/ is a peer twin of src/ so it rather made sense]\n<AfC> [it could have been tmp/generated/ too]\n<lifeless> AfC: thanks\n<thumper> lifeless: any idea on bug 485318 ?\n<ubottu> Launchpad bug 485318 in launchpad-foundations \"POSTToNonCanonicalURL error using bazaar client\" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/485318\n<lifeless> looks like a bug to me\n<thumper> lifeless: should I add a bzr task?\n<thumper> lifeless: or reassign?\n<lifeless> let me have a look\n<lifeless> what is %20 - ' ' ?\n<lifeless> yeah\n<thrope> hello - I was following loggerhead and noticed there have been no changes since may... my branch is following %7Eloggerhead-team/loggerhead/trunk/ but I had a look on launchpad and I think they moved to trunk-rich\n<thrope> can I do bzr switch in my tree?

We'd like to support something like that, but it hasn't gotten past the experimental stage yet.\n<Rotaerk_> hmm I wonder if git or mercurial can do that\n<spiv> Rotaerk_: that's what I was trying to say when I said \"bzr won't keep track of which version of libs/bar you happen to have in foo/\"\n<Rotaerk_> ah I see\n<Rotaerk_> is there any other way to go about what I'm wanting to do?\n<Rotaerk_> i.e. have particular revisions of A dependent on particular revisions of B\n<Rotaerk_> i think SVN can handle this using \"externals\"\n<Rotaerk_> though I've only heard about it\n<spiv> Rotaerk_: there are some plugins and add ons that might help\n<Rotaerk_> ah this is actually listed as a limitation on the bazaar site\n<spiv> Rotaerk_: http://bazaar-vcs.org/ScmProj is one, there was also a mailing list thread touching on this recently\n<spiv> Rotaerk_: it starts at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/bazaar/2009q4/064637.html\n<Rotaerk_> hmm thanks\n<igc> poolie: how does one get permission to upload to our +downloads page.

Otherwise, http.\n<bignose> I don't have a Launchpad account. can I easily make \u00e2\u0080\u0098lp:foo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use \u00e2\u0080\u0098bzr+http\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\n<Peng> LP doesn't support bzr+http.\n<bignose> argl\n<bignose> why on earth not?\n<Peng> Probably cuz all of the LP developers use bzr+ssh, so it's not important to them. :P\n<lifeless> bignose: time\n<lifeless> Peng: no\n<lifeless> Peng: we want to. Needs TUITS\n<bignose> it's not simply a matter of upgrading the Bazaar instance on Launchpad?\n<Peng> lifeless: TUITS?\n<Peng> bignose: It's a matter of...setting it up.\n<bignose> Peng: specifically, round tuits.\n<lifeless> http://www.myrtlewoodgallery.com/get_a_round_tuit.htm\n<lifeless> Peng: ^\n<bignose> as in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe haven't got a round tuit\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n<lifeless> bignose: its a deployment/testing issue\n<Peng> Ohhhhhhh.\n<bignose> hmm, perhaps there is something in Stephen J Turnbull's somplaints about the degree of difficulty in setting up a Bazaar server.\n<lifeless> Peng: a better one - http://www.stosyth.gov.uk/default.asp?calltype=sep03roundtuti\n<lifeless> bignose: its about 5 lines of apache config\n<lifeless> bignose: but we have loggerhead, which is fragile at scale, and we really don't want to destabilise that\n<lifeless> and they have to coexist on the same space.\n<bignose> okay. well, I can only agree with Stephen that it's a black eye for Bazaar when one's first likely interaction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 branching an existing project\u00e2\u0080\u0094 is dreadfully slow by default.\n * igc dinner\n<lifeless> bignose: setting up is in fact documented - 'running an http smart server'\n<AfC> I can't agree. Setting up a bzr:// server was easy.s\n<bignose> right, but that doesn't affect that Launchpad doesn't have it enabled, which immediately raises the question of why it's difficult for the experts to do. (and most people asking that question are likely to come to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause it's too difficult\u00e2\u0080\u009d conclusion)\n<lifeless> bzr+http is a little more fiddly, but not much.\n<bignose> um. what protocol does \u00e2\u0080\u0098bzr://\u00e2\u0080\u0099 run over? is it different from \u00e2\u0080\u0098bzr+http://\u00e2\u0080\u0099, \u00e2\u0080\u0098bzr+ssh://\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\n<bignose> it seems to me the read-only one is the important one for PR.\n<AfC> bignose: it runs over the bzr protocol\n<lifeless> omg the doc search is slow\n<Peng> bignose: bzr:// servers listen directly on TCP port 4155; they aren't tunnelled over SSH or HTTP or anything.\n<bignose> oh okay. well, that raises the question: if *that*'s the easy one to set up, why doesn't read-only \u00e2\u0080\u0098lp:foo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use that protocol by default instead of slow \u00e2\u0080\u0098http://\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\n<lifeless> bignose: because lp isn't a typical deployment.\n<lifeless> theres a db with virtual filesystem and 'stuff'\n<lifeless> as well as private branches to consider\n<AfC> lifeless: (which is a shame, because otherwise it would promote bzr:// quite well)\n<bignose> but it's the most public one. \u00e2\u0080\u009clet's see how Bazaar performs over the network\u00e2\u0080\u009d is highly likely to lead to branching a project from Launchpad without an account there.\n<lifeless> http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr.2.0/en/user-guide/http_smart_server.html documents how to run a bzr+http setup\n<lifeless> running bzr:// from inetd is ridiculously simple for straight forward environments (and savannah is AFAIK - its no where near as complicated a setup as LP's production environment)\n<bignose> and hence branching from \u00e2\u0080\u0098lp:foo\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which leads to HTTP without specifically asking for it, which leads one to think that Launchpad and/or Bazaar are very slow over the network.\n * fullermd still vaguely wishes he could setup bzr+http on a non-trivial setup...\n<lifeless> bignose: as I said, we want to do it. the team that is responsible also has a bunch of other things to do.\n<bignose> so I think this ties directly into Stephen's observations about PR and what Bazaar (and Launchpad, and Canonical, etc.) can do to improve image: get the most obvious Bazaar site working very fast by default.\n<lifeless> is it hard? not any harder than the other bugs they are working on. But they haven't gotten to it.\n<bignose> naturally. so perhaps, since Ian has published a guide, in response to Emacs developers needing to learn more about Bazaar, and specifically using Launchpad as a demonstration ... now is a good time to raise the priority of setting up a fast protocol by default for \u00e2\u0080\u0098lp:foo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 branch URLs.\n<bignose> to forestall a whole lot of Emacs developers, who might have otherwise been on the fence, having an abysmal first experience with Launchpad.\n<lifeless> I think that you should make this observation on the list.\n<bignose> okay, shall do.\n<lifeless> THe folk that need to see it are out drinking beer at the moment. ;)\n<bignose> lifeless: done, thanks.\n<bialix> hello\n * fullermd waves at bialix.\n * bialix waves back\n<bialix> hi fullermd :-)\n<Torty> hello\n<Peng> Hi.\n<stanman246> hi, not a bzr question, but i guessed i'll drop it anyway... Anyone using Krusader for filetransfers?\n<Torty> i have a question: it is possible to include the current Rev.number into my source files?\n<Torty> i.e. in sourcefile \"###bzr-rev###\" and bzr replace this with the current Rev. number?\n<Torty> i know in CVS/SVN it its possible\n<Torty> i think this replacement should be done by commit command\n<Torty> because only the currently commited files should be became the new rev.number\n<Torty> any idea?\n<Peng> Torty: Generally you make your build system do \"bzr revision-info >version.txt\" or somesuch.\n<Peng> Torty: But there is the bzr-keyword plugin if you want it.\n<Peng> Or is it \"bzr-keywords\"? I don't remember.\n<Torty> i think i dont know what you mean (advice: write simple english *g*)\n<Peng> Torty: The usual practice is to make your build system do it, using a command such as \"bzr revision-info\".\n<Peng> Torty: But there is a plugin that does what you want. See http://bazaar-vcs.org/KeywordExpansion\n<Torty> ok i read\n<Torty> ok it seems to be what i searching :-D thx\n<Peng> Torty: That page looks a little out-of-date. It might be better to start at https://launchpad.net/bzr-keywords\n<Torty> k\n<fullermd> The plugin functions more like PoC than usable code, for various reasons.  Some of the changes needed to really use it are only in 2.1, and I'm pretty sure some aren't anywhere yet.\n<Peng> Ah.\n * vila cries, testtools doesn't support python2.4 (it requires functools) :-( <- lifeless\n<lifeless> vila: https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~lifeless/testtools/2.4\n<jml> has bzr's auto-resolve behaviour changed recently?\n<lifeless> jml: I don't think so\n<jml> vila, lifeless: actually: lp:testtools\n<lifeless> vila: but you probably want that branch + my 0.9.1 branch.\n<jml> ungh\n<jml> Using '=' to underline things confuses the auto-resolver.\n<lifeless> jml: oh yeah, sorry.\n<lifeless> use ---- perhaos\n<jml> problem for another day, I think.\n<lifeless> or ++++ actually, that shouldn't be used there and should be unique\n * vila sends love to lifeless, jml and checks\n<fullermd> vila: By the by, 8.0 final release was finally cut.\n<vila> fullermd: Great, thanks for telling me, I'll upgrade asap\n<vila> jml, lifeless: lp:testtools still has the problem, trying 2.4 + 0.9.1 branches now\n<jml> vila, oops. pushed to wrong location\n * vila jumps on the brake pedal\n<jml> vila, lp:testtools should have 2.4 now\n * vila laughs at the commit message and wishes all commit messages were like that :)\n * vila confirms --parallel=fork works again with 2.4  \\o/\n<vila> 11 mins between tears and joy, who said bzr was slow ?\n<vila> yes, I know, that's a totally unfair reasoning :-D\n<fullermd> Man, that's pathetic.

Now I can do the branch bit :)\n<lifeless> jml: I would just push 0.9 to trunk again, is aall I meant\n<jml> lifeless, rather than merge?\n<lifeless> yes\n<lifeless> we haven't landed anything on trunk that we haven't also landed in 0.9\n<lifeless> if we had it would be different. Just a thought.\n<lifeless> I don't intrinsically care.\n<jml> done.\n<jml> that's a release, I think.\n<jml> crap.

The freeBSD8 VM just crashed...And it runs from a different host than the one I use to do IRC....\n<fullermd> vila: 's what you get for running emacs on it   :p\n<vila> fullermd: pfff, not even, it was running unattended :)\n<vila> fullermd: more seriously, since it crashed, I may as well upgrade now, http://wiki.freebsd.org/8.0TODO is out of date ?\n<fullermd> Dunno.  The last edit date is, what, a week and a half back, or something?\n<fullermd> Not sure how actively it was maintained during the RC cycle.\n<vila> fullermd: it's ok, just found http://www.freebsd.org/releases/8.0R/announce.html\n * fullermd glances at how recently the version control page was updated as long as he's bouncing around the wiki...\n<vila> hey ! vbox guest support !\n<vila> of course, just when I wanted to start migrating to kvm...\n * fullermd . o O ( Last real update: 2008-01-19 )\n<fullermd> Well.  That's almost certainly not much changed since the last few RC's   :p\n<vila> .. may be, but it may also mean I need some tweaks I'm not aware of...\n<fullermd> I guess the topic fizzled out of major notice after src moved CVS -> SVN.  Owell.\n<drmabuse_> Hello! Anyone an idea how stacked branches differ from others (regular ones)?\n<Peng> drmabuse_: Stacked branches don't store all of the revisions locally.\n<Peng> drmabuse_: They should function exactly the same as a normal branch, more or less.\n<GaryvdM> drmabuse_: A stacked branch does not have all the revsions in it's repository. It has a url to the branch that it is stacked on, and if bzr needs any revisions that are not in it's repository, it gets them from the stacked on branch.\n<Peng> GaryvdM++\n<Peng> You put it very well. :)\n<drmabuse_> Ah, thank you!\n<GaryvdM> Peng: thanks\n<drmabuse_> Great!\n * fullermd blinks.\n<fullermd> The heck...   how did I get a modified file in my bzr.dev tree...\n<fullermd> OK, what the hell?  log $FILE is showing 1 rev touching the file, log -n0 $FILE is showing 2, and there's no overlap between them.\n<fullermd> And none are actually direct edits, they're all merges.\n<fullermd> ...  OK, that's even weirder.  I revert it, and it STILL shows modified.\n<Peng> Kill dirstate?\n<Peng> (well, mv)\n<vila> what file is that ?\n<fullermd> Oh, I found it.\n<fullermd> Just snows to go you the sad state of content filtering.\n<fullermd> I still had a ~/.bazaar/rules file turning on keywords on *.txt, and doc/ja/user-reference/index.txt had something that ate.\n<Peng> \\o/\n<fullermd> Of course, on the plus side, that does show that revert Does The [Hypothetically] Right Thing with filters now   :p\n<fullermd> Insofar as deleting 372 lines of the file is Right, anyway...\n<fullermd> Mmph.  And it compresses things that aren't valid keywords either.\n<fullermd> Still freaky what log is doing there, though.\n<GaryvdM> fullermd: What file is it?\n<GaryvdM> Oh nvm - doc/ja/user-reference/index.txt\n<GaryvdM> fullermd: bzr log doc/ja/user-reference/index.txt , and bzr log doc/ja/user-reference/index.txt -n0 work as expected for me.   ?\n<fullermd> Well, now that I've updated bzr.dev, both show only 1 rev.  Just different 1 revs.\n<fullermd> And still both just merges.\n<GaryvdM> fullermd: bzr log doc/ja/user-reference/index.txt -n0 shows me 4 revisions - http://pastebin.com/d100bf598\n<GaryvdM> fullermd: bzr qlog doc/ja/user-reference/index.txt also the same\n<fullermd> Hm.\n<fullermd> How odd.  I get that too, without -v.  But with -v, kaplooie.\n<fullermd> That's pretty marfed up.  Why the hell should -v affect ANYTHING like that?\n<GaryvdM> fullermd: yhea - thats def a bug IMHO\n<GaryvdM> Hi vila\n<GaryvdM> vila: Is there a way do detect if some code is being run from a test?\n<vila> meh, where should I put the comma ?\n<GaryvdM> I don't know?\n<vila> GaryvdM: :-) Is it: 'some code is, being run from a test' or 'some code is being run, from a test'\n<GaryvdM> vila: I got a test where a exception is being caught by qbzr error reported, which shows a nice gui error report, and the error does not get to the test.\n<GaryvdM> vila: so I want to disable qbzr's error handler if it is being run from a test.\n<vila> haaa, you want the code to realize it's run by the test ?\n<GaryvdM> yes\n<vila> Don't ever do that or the code police will come to arrest you\n<GaryvdM> lol\n<vila> Instead, the test should alter the environment\n<fullermd> Nah, as long as they check with log -v, they'll never find it being introduced  :p\n<vila> The former is known as 'test code in production code' and very frowned upon :)\n<GaryvdM> vila: ok\n<vila> the reason being that it's cheating really :)\n<vila> log -v can find more revisions touching a file :-/ I don;t remember the details but I think it has to do mainly with file deletions\n<fullermd> No, it finds less.  Much less.\n<fullermd> Or rather, it finds more, but gives up really quick.\n * vila bangs head to wall\n<vila> err\n<vila> that's pretty unclear my dear friend :)\n<GaryvdM> fullermd: vlia is right, normal log file won't find a revisions that deletes a file\n<GaryvdM> -v will\n<GaryvdM> vila: compaire bzr log doc/ja/user-reference/index.txt -n0  to bzr log doc/ja/user-reference/index.txt -n0 -v\n<vila> fullermd: but log and log -v are on amanica plate again IIUC\n<vila> so filing bugs now may be a good idea\n<vila> GaryvdM: aaargh, vade retro satanas, I want to go have lunch, don't make me vomit :-(\n<GaryvdM> sorry\n<vila> that's pretty ugly :(\n<vila> err, can I really use pretty and ugly like that ?\n<vila> bbl, will have lunch anyway\n<GaryvdM> vila/fullermd: I've loged bug 489179\n<ubottu> Launchpad bug 489179 in bzr \"log file -v misses some revisions\" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/489179\n<GaryvdM> vila: when you are back from lunch, would this be an acpetable way to \"alter the environment\" : http://pastebin.com/d75e9a627 ?\n<vila> GaryvdM: with the tweaks http://pastebin.com/m285da0a9 , yes\n<lifeless> vila: would like your feedback on assertThat (in testtools 0.9.1)\n<GaryvdM> vila: thanks\n<vila> and regarding that bug, log -v shows *only* the revisions touching the file, while log, once it found a revision, also displays the ones that merge it (I forgot that case earlier),\n<vila> so the bug is presumably about the \"right\" revision being lost while the merging ones are shown, because 4792.5.5 really add the file and I presume nobody ever touch it since\n<vila> lifeless: is that about the matchers I saw mentioned in the commit messages ?\n<lifeless> yes\n<lifeless> see NEWS and the MANUAL\n<thrope> is it possible to share subversion.conf between machines - to the checksums int here come from the svn repository or are they randomly generated (ie does it make any sense) - I guess I was hoping if I accessed the same repo on another machine the checksum would be the same\n<vila> lifeless: after reading NEWS and MANUAL, I'm still hungry :-) Now reading matchers.py\n<vila> that was quick :)\n<vila> I recognize that DocTestMatches as very closely resembling my needs in shell-like tests :)\n<lifeless> if you want to see it in use, look at test_testresult.py\n<vila> yeah, I see that... making doctest.ELLIPSIS the default sounds sensible...

This time https://code.launchpad.net/~gagern/trac-bzr/bug194277/+merge/15323 in particular, as it removes quite a large portion of (supposedly unused) code. I'd love a second opinion here!\n<vila> MvG: I know nothing about trac-bzr, but given the work your putting into it, you clearly seem to be the de-facto maintainer...\n<jldupont> vila: yes it seems.\n<MvG> And become so in little more than a week, or so it seems.\n<MvG> I feel like every time I fix a bug, I find a new one.\n<vila> as such, you'd better just take over the trunk and wait for people to complain or, more likely, thank you :)\n<MvG> I'll have done unreviewed commits in the past, and will likely do more in the future, especially if I get no reviews here.\n<MvG> On the other hand, I've gotten some very useful input from reviews, so I'd at least give people a chance to look things over.\n<vila> ha ok, I thought you didn't get any\n<vila> jldupont: ok, I misunderstood, I thought you were on hardy :-/\n<jldupont> vila: no probs.\n<jldupont> vila: I installed the latest xmloutput (from what verterok wrote earlier): still blows up in my face.\n<verterok> jldupont: did you removed the system wide installed xmloutput?\n<jldupont> verterok: yes.... got Synaptic to do it.\n<jldupont> is this ok?\n<verterok> yes\n<jldupont> I have zapped my .bzr from my project...\n<jldupont> rebuilding everything now...\n<verterok> jldupont: and did you updated the xmloutput in .bazaar/plugins ?\n<vila> jldupont, verterok: that shouldn't matter if the .bazaar/plugins one is loaded, which 'bzr plugins -v' should confirm\n<jldupont> xmloutput 0.8.6.dev\n<jldupont>     This plugin adds an option (--xml) to log and provides an xml version of some\n<jldupont>     /home/jldupont/.bazaar/plugins/xmloutput\n<verterok> jldupont: ok, good\n<verterok> jldupont: are you getting the same error?\n<jldupont> Exception in Decorator.

If the core executables and modules all make a single logical project unit, then they can all go into a single bzr branch\n<bialix> chx: yes\n<chx> bialix: And how...?\n<vila> bialix: interactive tests make no sense for automation in my mind, what are you talking about ?\n<Imperion> dOxxx: okay\n<chx> bialix: I read the help for both co and serve and saw no way :/\n<chx> bialix: some conf file?\n<bialix> chx: you mix bzr serve and bzr+ssh\n<chx> oh i do not even need bzr serve when urnning bzr+ssh?\n<chx> that ... makes sense, i suppose?\n<bialix> chx: no\n<bialix> bzr+ssh launch bzr serve via ssh automatically\n<vila> GaryvdM: if I run 'bzr qlog trunk just_show_tests' it shows 46 additional revisions, what's up ?\n<chx> bialix: aaaaaaah\n<bialix> vila: do you have old trunk? new trunk is trunk2a\n<vila> bialix: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh\n<vila> I updated old trunk :-(\n<vila> I *upgraded* old trunk\n<bialix> that's fine, run pull --remember lp:qbzr now :-)\n<vila> right\n<vila> only 2 revisions now\n<bialix> Imperion: every branch is separate entity\n<vila> aaargh again, I ran 'pull --overwrite' and forgot --remember, you guys drive me nuts ;)\n * bialix said --remember, not overwrite\n<bialix> vila: we don't want, honestly\n * vila did it before bialix gave the right invocation :)\n<bialix> rats, I've late\n<chx> bialix: ok then is there a config value like the user=joe in authentication.conf to supply a sort of base bath?\n<vila> GaryvdM: so, a couple of remarks\n * GaryvdM listens\n<Imperion> bialix: meaning\n<Imperion> ?\n<vila> instead of doing try/finally, use addCleanup, that avoids errors and indentations\n<bialix> chx: mmm, no. But I think you can try to use settings in authorized_keys on the server\n<bialix> Imperion: do you want all your modules to live in separate branches?\n<chx> bialix: like....?\n<vila> GaryvdM: i.e. self.addCleanup(win.close) just after the win is created\n<chx> bialix: or set the home directory of the bzr user.\n<bialix> chx: look in contrib/bzr_access to get some ideas\n<chx> i will\n<GaryvdM> vila: we have code that runs when the windows close (like saveing the window sizes.) What would happen if there was and error in that code?\n<vila> GaryvdM: don't override trace.report_exception unconditionally, you will regret it one day or another, do that in a setUp() and again use addCleanup to restore the original\n<bialix> Imperion: you can put your entire project into one big branch, or use separate branches for every module\n<Imperion> bialix: all of the parts depend on the core\n<vila> GaryvdM: don't worry, errors are allowed during cleanup methods, but they generally indicate deeper problems\n<bialix> Imperion: yes, but do your modules have thevalue by itself? to reuse them in other similar project?\n<Imperion> no\n<Imperion> they're useless without the core\n<bialix> Imperion: then put all modules into one big branch with core\n<bialix> Imperion: just think why you call them modules and separate from core?\n<GaryvdM> vila: Re overriding report_exception: What would be a good way to make that common among lots of test? (can you think of an example in bzrlib?)\n<bialix> Imperion: in bzr world branch is main thing, it's often synonym to repo in other systems\n<GaryvdM> vila: The big question is, is it ok to show and hide the gui from the test suit like that?\n<vila> GaryvdM: define a base class or a mixing that all test classes that requires the feature will use\n<GaryvdM> ok\n<Imperion> bialix: they're modules because they're interchangeable with other modules with the same interface\n<bialix> GaryvdM: I wonder if we actually can use QtTest\n<Imperion> bialix: e.g. multiple video driver modules\n<vila> GaryvdM: yes it is, bzr-gtk does that\n<vila> or did\n<bialix> Imperion: so they have value by itself? with other core?\n<Imperion> sorry?\n<vila> hmm, let me try a trick or two\n<bialix> Imperion: there are several reasons to not put modules into the same branch as core\n<bialix> Imperion: because once you put them there you'll have problems to split this branch later\n<vila> hehe, it works :)\n<Imperion> bialix: modules depend on the core to compile\n<bialix> Imperion: but there is one big reasons to do so: much simpler to clone entire project\n<GaryvdM> bialix: Yes - QTest will help when we want to test things like clicking on a button.\n<vila> GaryvdM: http://paste.ubuntu.com/329520/\n<bialix> GaryvdM: In my undertsanding QtTest can help to avoid actually show the GUI?\n<bialix> Imperion: what you need called nested trees\n<vila> bialix: look at my pastebin, no more windows showing up :-D\n<Imperion> bialix: explain?\n<bialix> Imperion: but they are not implemented yet\n<Imperion> >_>\n<GaryvdM> vila: I'm not sure if that will cause paint events to run - I run with --coverage to check\n<bialix> Imperion: you can organise several separate branches into complex project\n<vila> GaryvdM: could be, let me know\n<bialix> and work with such construct as with one big branch\n<bialix> vila: hehe, nice\n<GaryvdM> bialix: As far as I can see from the docs, no\n<bialix> Imperion: there is 3rd party tools to manage this problem though\n<bialix> Imperion: config-manager utility; scmproj, externals plugins\n<Imperion> mhmm\n<bialix> Imperion: I'm the author of scmproj\n<bialix> scmproj is somewhat emulation of nested trees\n<bialix> Imperion: do you familiar with svn?\n<bialix> or CVS?\n<Imperion> no\n<bialix> Imperion: no other VCS experience?\n<Imperion> nope\n<bialix> ok\n<Imperion> my project is hosted on Launchpad\n<Imperion> will this be possible? :S\n<bialix> is and will in last 2 sentences are conflict\n<bialix> yes, it's possible\n<vila> Imperion: why do you want to separate the modules if they require trunk ? (I.e. they make no sense without trunk)\n<bialix> what is your project? it's open source as I understand\n<Imperion> vila: I don't want anything, I'm asking for advice\n<Imperion> bialix: 2D isometric RTS engine, https://launchpad.net/catom\n<Imperion> the code currently available is old\n<Imperion> I've refactored everything\n<bialix> vila: Imerion said the modules can be changed by similar with the same interface, sounds like pluggable architecture for me\n<Imperion> bialix: it is\n<Imperion> and I'm wondering about improving the organization of it\n<bialix> vila, Imperion: therefore I'd suggest to not put plugins into the same branch as core\n<vila> Imperion: sry, my advice will then be: don't separate modules from trunk if there is a strong dependency, just keep them in the same branch\n<Peng> After 80 hours, \"bzr check\" on 1.14 MySQL is *still* at \"[####\\               ] checking commit contents:inventories 0/2\". I might give up soon.\n<Imperion> dun dun dun\n<vila> bialix: that's just asking for trouble if they should always be kept synchronized\n<bialix> the truth is: you can merge all your separate modules into core branch easily but not vice versa\n<bialix> Imperion: so you need some experiments\n<Imperion> I wonder how I'll fix the CMake script to work with this\n<MorbusIff> if i checkout a bzr branch, is my commit access to it allowed or unallowed, barring any other configuration?\n<vila> haaa, GaryvdM is back !\n<bialix> back from Ubuntu\n<vila> GaryvdM: why don't you use a VM instead of a double boot ?\n<GaryvdM> in ubuntu\n<GaryvdM> vila: Yes I should\n * bialix does not know cmake specific, can't say much useful\n<bialix> Imperion: single branch with all modules + core would be much simpler to you right now, given in mind lack of good nested trees support\n<Imperion> okay\n<bialix> I'm working on new design of scmproj, I'm hope I'll have better support of critical features soon\n<GaryvdM> vila: The window still flashes for me :-(\n<GaryvdM> vila: and the paint methods don't get run.\n<GaryvdM> vila: I'm going to make your other changes though.\n<vila> GaryvdM: forget about the cheap trick then, we may want to try harder when I add the plugins to babune\n<vila> GaryvdM: but even there you may add some feature check to ensure there is a usable display\n<GaryvdM> vila: yes - I hope to still find a solution.\n<vila> GaryvdM: don't spend too much time on it now, it's better to have tests that requires some feature than no tests :)\n<GaryvdM> vila: but for now, it's a start in the right direction I believe.\n<GaryvdM> vila: yes\n<vila> GaryvdM: definitely !!\n<vila> GaryvdM, bialix : gtg, have a nice week-end !\n<GaryvdM> Bye vila - Thanks for the help.\n<bialix> gtg?\n<GaryvdM> got to go\n<vila> gotta go\n<bialix> bye vila, thanks!\n<bialix> GaryvdM: I'm ok with your new flashing tests\n<bialix> GaryvdM: btw, one observation about exception dialog reporter\n<bialix> if I click X button on this dialog or press Esc then it treats this as Ignore.

Can't connect to answers.launchpad.net (some network problem). I am using git for 1,5y and now I am in a company where bzr is popular.

I am using git for 1,5y and now I am in a company where bzr is popular. I considered switching and I have a question about a feature I use 100% of time in git: interactive add. Is there something like that? I found shelve feature, but it looks like stash in git (i.e. isn't the one I am after)\n<rittyan1> i.e., can I commit hunks or lines I pick from a file, instead of whole file\n<maxb> So I'd have to enumerate each project separately in the bzr-svn config?\n<dOxxx> rittyan: Somebody suggested trying bzr-interactive\n<GaryvdM> rittyan1: https://launchpad.net/bzr-interactive\n<jelmer> maxb: You can use multiple asterisks in the wildcard layout\n<maxb> branches = */branches/*;*/trunk  ?\n<dOxxx> rittyan: also, you can use shelve to accomplish something like git's staging area. you shelve the changes you don't want, commit the rest and then unshelve.\n<rittyan1> dOxxx: troublesome\n<rittyan1> and that plugin looks... \"new\", according to bugs\n<jelmer> maxb: for example\n<rittyan1> also, as I understand, plugin => no support in gui\n<jelmer> maxb: asterisks will only cover one directory level\n<GaryvdM> rittyan1: I'm one of the devlopers of qbzr. I hope to add support for that soon.\n<jelmer> maxb, you might need \"*/trunk; */*/trunk; */*/*/trunk\", etc\n<rittyan1> dOxxx: I do series of commits at once, making them small and per-feature from big changes. Shelving/Unshelving is definitely troublesome with such workflow :<\n<dOxxx> rittyan: yeah. although to be honest, shelve -> commit is pretty much the same amount of effort as stage -> commit, if you ask me. :)\n<dOxxx> rittyan: if you're using this to separate feature commits, perhaps you should be trying feature branches.\n<rittyan1> feature branch is something like creating a branch per feature? Like, `git branch ticket-1234`\n<dOxxx> rittyan: yes. usually used in conjunction with a shared repository so as to save disk space and make the branching quick.\n<rittyan1> I use that workflow already :) it's just isn't wise to use it to add a function (one commit), then put this function to use (another commit), for example\n<rittyan1> damn, I am addicted, it seems :/ without hope to switching\n<dOxxx> rittyan: for sure, it's best used in a somewhat coarse manner, like a bug per branch, etc.\n<dOxxx> hmmm\n<dOxxx> rittyan: comment #10 and #16 on http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git are interesting\n<dOxxx> rittyan: something that may also be useful to you is bzr-pipeline or bzr-loom\n<rittyan1> dOxxx: I don't get what it says. I never had any problems with testing or whatsoever, hm :<\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: it's more of a general principle thing. The changes committed using git's staging area have not been tested on their own as you're committing them.\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: anyway, I'm just saying it's an interesting perspective. I personally found the staging area quite useful in some cases when I was using git a while back.\n<rittyan1> care to share what do you do when you write a function, put it to use, make cosmetic changes (you are on a coding spree) and then you need to make 3 commits of it?\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: my usual working environment uses cvs, so in that case I cry. ;)\n<rittyan1> what about your after-work life :)\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: but using bzr, I would use shelve to separate the changes\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: or if the cosmetic changes are closely related to the function I added, I would probably just include it in the one commit\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: commit history doesn't have to be an exact replica of the process you went through to make the changes.\n<rittyan1> of course, that's why I spent an hour today moving back and forth commits for 3 prev. weeks, squashing or \"fixing\" then a bit\n<rittyan1> before pushing to public\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: using git or bzr?\n<rittyan1> I am using git\n<rittyan1> I never tried bzr yet, but a lot of people at work do\n<rittyan1> I am preparing myself :)\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: as I understand it, when you merge stuff from one git repo to another, the target repo gets the individual commit messages. so if you commit with messages \"1\", \"2\", \"3\" and then merge to another repo, that repo will have revisions with messages \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", right?\n<dOxxx> hmm\n<dOxxx> although I think I'm mixing up my terminology. merge is not push. :)\n<rittyan1> hmm I am not sure I got it, but what you say looks correct to me. Also, I used merge only once maybe, in 1.5y of using git\n<rittyan1> I am rebase kind of user\n<lifeless> moin\n<rittyan1> (i.e. try to stack commits from one branch on top of another and fix conflicts if there any)\n<rittyan1> moin lifeless\n<dOxxx> anyway, the point I was trying to make is that using feature branches and merging them into a trunk means that the \"messy\" nature of the commits on the feature branch are hidden.\n<dOxxx> because the merge appears as a single revision with your merge commit message on the trunk\n<rittyan1> dOxxx: yes that's why I don't like merging :))\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: however, bzr does expose the individual commits of the merge if you want\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: check out this example: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bzr-pqm/bzr/bzr.dev/revision/4832\n<rittyan1> what at I should take a closer look there?\n<rittyan1> ah! got it\n<dOxxx> if you follow the link \"4831.1.1 integration\" on that page, that takes you to the branch vila merged into trunk\n<rittyan1> except that I don't see any individual commits there\n<dOxxx> on the page for vila's branch you can see 4815.3.8 quiet-serve\n<dOxxx> that's *my* feature branch\n<dOxxx> if you then click the view history link you'll see the individual commits\n<dOxxx> but note that all this info is coming from the bzr.dev trunk repo\n<dOxxx> the bzr GUI log tool, qlog, shows it quite a nice way\n<rittyan1> I think that I should give it a try\n<rittyan1> and see if I like it\n<rittyan1> because anyway, sooner or later I will probably have to face bzr\n<rittyan1> like it or not :/\n<dOxxx> it's not that bad ;)\n<rittyan1> and one more question: there must be rebase, I bet. Interactive one? :)\n<GaryvdM> rittyan1: Here is a screen shot of those revisions in qlog: http://imagebin.ca/view/IjcR0oL.html\n<rittyan1> GaryvdM: looks like typical git log in gui\n<rittyan1> except that green node has trailing pink changes that have no parent\n<GaryvdM> the parent is off the screen\n<rittyan1> this is that? commits existed during merge?\n<rittyan1> ah, right\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: yes\n<GaryvdM> rittyan: note that you can also colapse and expand those merges, like a tree\n<dOxxx> rittyan1: there is a plugin for rebase/rewrite\n<GaryvdM> rittyan1: Yes - there is rebase, via plugin. See http://bazaar-vcs.org/Rebase\n<rittyan1> does it mean that on public repos people will know about my private <s>life</s> commits?\n<dOxxx> if it's merged, yes\n<dOxxx> you could always email patches ;)\n<GaryvdM> Hopefully you don't commit you private life to a public repo ;-)\n<dOxxx> brb, disconnecting vpn\n<rittyan1> hmm, thanks for help\n<rittyan1> honestly it all sounds very limited, no offence...

(acutally I didn't think you could merge unrelated branches)\n<thrope> I get bzr: ERROR: Branches have no common ancestor, and no merge base revision was specified.  when I test merging\n<jelmer> you can merge unrelated branches by specifying -r0..-1\n<thrope> same with bzr merge -r 1 ../a\n<thrope> ah\n<thrope> great thanks\n<thrope> only thing is it pulls the whole history of other branch (i guess obvious) but I only really want to changes of that file\n<bing> hey folks.  i'm looking for a volunteer to take a cvs tree, and a svn tree and merge them into a single bzr tree.  i know it can't be much fun, but i figure *somebody* has to like doing this stuff.\n<thrope> mwhudson: another minor loggerhead thing... running another public instance at a nonroot url (but still https, apache proxypass)... if I go to https://www.host.net/\u001cbzr/ then everything works perfect but if I got to https://www.host.net/\u001cbzr (no trailing slash) then the repo links on the browsing page are broken (go to host.net/repo instead of host.net/bzr/repo)...\n<thrope> I tried playing with apache settings a bit, and have --prefix set in loggerheadd script; running the relative links patches from the other day\n<Glenjamin> we're looking at possibly setting up bazaar for our office, and i'm looking into how to get an access controlled central repository with access only over an encrypted transport - currently i think my options are bzr+https with auth via apache, and bzr+ssh with a wrapper like http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bzr-pqm/bzr/bzr.dev/annotate/head%3A/contrib/bzr_ssh_path_limiter - can anyone offer some...\n<Glenjamin> ...advice?\n<vila> Glenjamin: Looks like you already found the right bits, do you have more precise questions ?\n<Glenjamin> well, what would be the performance implications of one or the other\n<vila> The performances should be roughly equivalent AFAIK, you're adding either SSL or ssh encryption anyway\n<Glenjamin> i think the second option would allow me to supply per-branch permissions as well - but i'm unsure if this would screw up with file ownership\n<vila> Ha\n<Glenjamin> my main issue is that i've got to convince our sysadmin that either of these is better than the git equivalent :)\n<vila> http[s] implies a single user on the remote host whereas ssh allows you to either use a single one or several, it depends on how you configure things\n<vila> What is the git equivalent on the admin side ?\n<Glenjamin> well if we were using the https approach, i think we'd have to wrap it with http auth\n<Glenjamin> there's either git-daemon, which is pretty much bzr serve, so no encryption\n<Glenjamin> or ssh, where there's a git-shell which is a bit like the python script i linked to above\n<vila> Right, so both use a single account on the remote host for ssh right ?\n * vila thinks a single right should be enough...\n<Glenjamin> well i was mostly expecting that each developer should have their own credentials, in the https case this would be done via apache, and for ssh it'd just be different user accounts\n<beuno> vila, hi!\n<vila> beuno: hey !\n<vila> Glenjamin: so, if you go the several accounts route, you will encounter more problems to share, since the file system persmissions will come into play, what OS is used on the remote host ?\n<Glenjamin> ubuntu\n<Glenjamin> i suppose one user with multiple keys might be a decent compromise, so that each user has different credentials to log in\n<vila> that's a good point ;) What release (just out of curiosity but also to check which bzr version is available there)\n<beuno> vila, did you get my messages?\n<Glenjamin> i think its jaunty\n<Glenjamin> but i might be able to talk him into adding the bazaar ppa\n<vila> beuno: not yet I presume, I haven't check my mail yet, but I've seen your messages here, I'll will look at that closely and soon, but may be not right now :-)\n<vila> Glenjamin: gee, but you already know all the tricks ! Why are you asking questions :-)\n<Glenjamin> because its not me that needs convincing :)\n<vila> hehe\n<Glenjamin> i've been using bazaar for personal stuff, plus bzr-svn at work for a while\n<Glenjamin> we're looking at using a DVCS for new projects, but everyone else is leaning towards git, mainly because of the visibility of github\n<Glenjamin> ie. they want to use git because its probably more popular\n<vila> Glenjamin: So, IMHP, the safer (as in: simpler, less trouble, hence raising less questions from your admin) is the single ssh account and the additional script\n<Glenjamin> makes sense\n<Glenjamin> and then loggerhead proxied through apache for web browsing\n<vila> yup\n<vila> the biggest question may be which workflows you want to allow, is it a single trunk on the host or also the ability for each dev to mirror its own branches or do you want team branches where several dev can commit too, etc\n<Glenjamin> i think it'll be a nominated mainline per project, and then all development branches mirrored to the repo\n<Glenjamin> and there's no real reason i can see why some dev branches cant be shared\n<vila> beuno: regarding pyftpd, I'm pretty sure I documented the URL to download from somewhere, there is no debian/ubuntu package AFAIK, but it's a single .py file\n<vila> Glenjamin: then, would you restrict the sharing or should everybody be able to write everywhere ?\n<Glenjamin> hrm, ideally we'd want to be able to restrict some repos to certain users\n<vila> Did you look at the bzr_access script too ?\n<vila> disclaimer: I haven't use either\n<Glenjamin> i skimmed it earlier, loggerhead is having a fit any wont show it to me anymore :(\n<vila> Glenjamin: Hey ! Are you related to Neil Martinsen-Burell ???\n<Glenjamin> i'm not\n<Glenjamin> but if i recall he's been doing some stuff on a bug i reported\n<vila> gelnjamin.co.uk having trouble with http authenticated access after redirection ?\n<Glenjamin> yup\n<vila> bug #395714 ?\n<ubottu> Launchpad bug 395714 in bzr \"Redirect to location protected by HTTP auth fails\" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/395714\n<Glenjamin> thats the one\n<vila> That's weird, he seems to be able to reproduce the bug and I'm not :-/\n<Glenjamin> hrm, i'll update bzr on this machine and have a go\n<vila> Regarding your remark about loggerhead, you mean you don't have the bzr sources locally ?\n<Glenjamin> i'm aiming to replace the setup we have at the moment which is SVN over DAV with apache, where the devs dont have any other access to that box\n<vila> bzr_access should be far enough with a single ssh account then. At least that's how I understand its intent.\n<vila> beuno: still there ?\n<vila> beuno: good, enjoy your week-end :-D\n<Glenjamin> hrm, i think i'd only be able to get per-branch (ie. per-project) access control if i go back to the bzr+https approach\n<Glenjamin> the ssh command bazaar sends to start up the hpss using ssh doesnt know which branch its after\n<beuno> vila, kind of\n<Glenjamin> vila: updated to all the latest bzr releases, and i can still reproduce the bug\n<Glenjamin> which version are you using?\n<vila> Glenjamin: lp:~vila/bzr/395714-auth-redirect\n<vila> the bug is genuine, but Neil said even eith the fix in the branch above he still reproduces the bug\n<j85wilson> I have, in my code tree, several directories which contain code which is compiled into executables.

I still can't get the testsuite to tun FTPServer tests though\n<vila> beuno: if you're using python2.6 you need pyftpdlib\n<mathrick> seriously, git is just retarded\n * jelmer waves\n<mathrick> jelmer: hola!\n<jelmer> mathrick, everything except for true push should be working\n<mathrick> cool, can I use it directly on a git-cloned repo, or do I need to go through bzr-git?\n<beuno> vila, where do I get it from?\n * vila searching for the pyftpdlib URL\n<jelmer> mathrick: you should be able to use it directly on a git-cloned repo\n<mathrick> yay\n * mathrick pants a little\n<jelmer> mathrick, although that'll still have some quirks since there is no equivalent of the index in bzr\n<mathrick> jelmer: right now just getting me bzr missing with git will be way awesomer than plain git :)\n<Glenjamin> i'm having trouble compiling bzr on windows - its saying cannoy find -lzdll, which i'm sure i've seen before and solved\n<Glenjamin> does it ring any bells for anyone?\n<jelmer> mathrick, that won't work on remote git repositories unfortunately though\n<vila> beuno: as mentioned in bzrlib/tests/ftp_server/pyftpdlib.py : http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/\n<beuno> vila, where do I put it?\n<vila> beuno: no debian/ubuntu packages AFAIK, but it's a simple py file, put it somewhere in your PYTHONPATH\n<beuno> aiight\n<vila> $HOME/lib/python  :)\n<jelmer> mathrick: (it's impossible since the server doesn't provide enough data)\n<mathrick> bah\n<mathrick> why does it have to be so stupid and so popular?\n<vila> Glenjamin: rings a bell too... should be mentioned in setup.py or one of its included files\n<mathrick> jelmer: so how does it handle that situation? Or does it not? :)\n<vila> Glenjamin: or maybe you have to rename something.... isn't there a wiki page about building on windows ?\n<beuno> vila, that worked!  (and they all passed)\n<vila> Glenjamin: http://bazaar-vcs.org/WindowsInstall says:     *\n<vila>       Zlib - zlib123-dll.zip | Homepage Extract zlib123-dll.zip to temporary folder and copy zlib1.dll into C:\\Windows\\System32\n<vila> beuno: you rock !\n<Glenjamin> ah, thanks\n<beuno> vila, would be nice to make a package for that  *wink*\n<Glenjamin> there's about 6 different wiki pages for bazaar install on windows :D\n<vila> Glenjamin: feel free to add comments pointing to the one that works for you ! It's a wiki :D\n<Glenjamin> i'll test it first, i get the feeling that this step might be more for VS than GCC\n<jelmer> mathrick: it can't unless somebody fixes the git smart server\n<jelmer> mathrick, it'll simply tell you \"not supported over git://\"\n<j85wilson> well, I haven't been able to make that regex (or any variant thereof) work properly either.\n<Glenjamin> vila: right, finally managed to build the branch - i get a KeyError on 'protocol' now\n<Glenjamin> i wonder if it might be simpler to use a defaultdict with None for auth\n<j85wilson> does anybody know why \"Regular expression patterns may not include named or numbered groups.\"?  This seems a silly restriction to someone who doesn't know anything.\n<vila> Glenjamin: grrr, I don't think so, the problem is I can't figure which codepath is involved in your case, can you provide me with a .bzr.log for a command run with -Dhttp (taking care of removing any auth header that may reveal your credentials (that includes Basic or Dihest related headers)\n<mathrick> woah, I haven't visited the bzr page in a long time it seems\n * mathrick wonders at the shiny new look\n<Glenjamin> that url isnt a real branch, its just an empty repository with http auth on\n<vila> Glenjamin: -Dhttp will tell me :)\n<vila> Glenjamin: you can send me the .bzr.log by mail if you prefer, if any credentials are left, at least you'll have only one culprit to track :)\n<Glenjamin> http://pastebin.com/m32e6c375\n<Glenjamin> i'm fairly sure there arent any valid credentials for that auth config anyway\n<vila> bzr-svn !\n<vila> jelmer: are you using the _urllib2_wrappers ability to follow redirections ?\n<vila> Glenjamin: can you retry that with and additional --no-plugins ?\n<vila> s/and/an/\n<Glenjamin> yup\n<jelmer> vila: no\n<Glenjamin> works now\n<vila> :)\n<vila> :-/\n<vila> Glenjamin: ok, at least I know where to search (even if jelmer pretends to be innocent :-D)\n<jelmer> :)\n<Glenjamin> the issues all stem from trying to access non-existant keys in the auth dict\n<vila> Glenjamin: that's the apparent cause, a deeper one is that we shouldn't use that code path but one that create the auth dict correctly,\n<vila> http://pastebin.com/m241bae14 jelmer, you lied :-D\n<vila> that's really funny because *I* should provide OPTIONS to jelmer so he can use it safely :)\n<Glenjamin> _urlib2_wrappers.py line 360\n<vila> Glenjamin: look at the comment just above\n<jelmer> vila: that's not using the redirections following code though\n<Glenjamin> the comment just above says \"containing at least...\"\n<Glenjamin> and then creates dicts which clearly dont\n<vila> jelmer: yes it is, except we don;t have the same definition of redirections following code ;)\n<vila> Glenjamin: that's because callers should do that (look at http/__init__ create_auth)\n<vila> the redirection code in _urllib2_wrappers don't handle auth correctly (as that bug revealed) instead, callers are supposed to use the do_catching_redirections in transport/__init__\n<vila> jelmer: the bug is really that bzr http transport don't provide OPTIONS, don't you think ?\n<vila> rotfl\n<beuno> vila, thanks for the review,r eplied\n<jelmer> vila: yeah, HttpTransport should really have options\n<vila> for those not understanding the joke, we had a discussion with jelmer about whether OPTIONS should be supported by bzr even if it's isn't required internally :D\n * vila feels dragged into working on bzr when he should be working on family backups :0)\n<Glenjamin> now i remember why i gave up trying to follow this call chain when i first reported this one :D\n<vila> beuno: about the README, I'm all for helping people find the relevant bits, but I'm against duplication since it leads to out-of-date info, how about putting the right pointers in the README ? Or separating the concerns and do that in another merge proposal ?\n<beuno> vila, sure, I'll drop it from that branch\n<vila> Glenjamin: yeah, the design is inherited from the python urllib2, in retrospect, it was a bad idea, but it helped building the actual implementation and all the related feaures: connection sharing, proxy support, various auth schemes, all of which weren't supported by urllib2 :-/\n<vila> eeerk low batteries for keyboard, priority interrupt\n<mathrick> jelmer: I ran into some crashes: http://pastebin.com/m5b10d31d\n<jelmer> mathrick, please file a bug\n<mathrick> ok\n<sjamaan> Is there a way to get bzr diff to output files which don't include the entire path?\n<sjamaan> ie, I do bzr diff under foo/bar/qux and it generates a diff for file foo/bar/qux/mooh.c, instead of just mooh.c\n<eelik> will colocated branches aka fasces be supported soon?\n<lifeless> eelik: they aren't the same thing, and no one knows :)\n<eelik> How they are different?\n<lifeless> fasces is a fullermd term to describe something he would like to see\n<lifeless> colocated branches is a jelmer created term to describe something he would like to see\n<eelik> but basically both describe the \"git-style branches\" where one working tree is shared by many branches in one directory?\n<eelik> That's a feature I'd like to see...\n<eelik> So there's actually no schedule for implementing either?\n#bzr 2009-11-29\n<lifeless> eelik: there is no schedule for either. But you can just use a tree-less repository and a single working tree which you run 'bzr switch' to switch between.\n<eelik> I know, but it's clumsy\n<eelik> can't compete with git\n<lifeless> eelik: true; you're welcome to work on reducing the clumsiness\n<lifeless> (or on those other proposals)\n<mathrick> jelmer: poke?\n<mathrick> jelmer: bzr st on git branches seems wonky, it doesn't report modified files that haven't been added to the index\n<jelmer> mathrick, hi\n<jelmer> mathrick, you need to \"git add\" them again to see the changes\n<mathrick> yeah, I know, but I was expecting bzr st to tell me about the changes\n<jelmer> mathrick, you probably just want a bzr working tree in that case\n<lifeless> jelmer: It would be nice if 'bzr st' behaved as bzr does here.\n<lifeless> jelmer: that is, to refresh the index\n<mathrick> jelmer: possible, I use bzr-git as more bearable git for working on code with git upstream; what's the least painful setup in this case?\n<jelmer> lifeless: sure, but somebody would have to code that up\n<jelmer> lifeless: it's nontrivial since we can't really trust the index\n<jelmer> lifeless, but we also would like to avoid writing to the index on read operations\n<lifeless> jelmer: the index is ~= dirstate, and we write to the dirstate on read operations.\n<jelmer> lifeless: but that's just the stat cache though, isn't it?\n<jelmer> lifeless, modifying the actual contents of the index seems more dubious to me\n<lifeless> jelmer: we don't version or unversion things\n<lifeless> jelmer: but I'm not suggesting we do that here either.\n<jelmer> lifeless: not versioning/unversioning a particular file, but versioning a particular revision of a fil\n<jelmer> \"git status\" would give different output when run after \"bzr status\"\n<lifeless> jelmer: yes, it would match whats on disk more ;)\n<jelmer> lifeless: :-)\n<lifeless> jelmer:  you will get complaints either way ;)\n<jelmer> lifeless: Yes, and it is the way it is because it doesn't require any effort on my part ;-)\n<jelmer> *extra\n<mathrick> jelmer: the other way is more useful for the bzr-git user though\n<mathrick> I think it's fairly safe to assume that people who use bzr-git are expecting more bzr-like behaviour\n<mathrick> jelmer: anyway, how hard will it be to push/send patches upstream if I switch to a bzr tree instead of operating on the git tree directly?\n<jelmer> mathrick: it wouldn't be any harder/less hard than using a git repository locally I think\n<jelmer> mathrick: The index won't ever be a 1-to-1 match with a bzr working tree\n<jelmer> I think the best solution would be to keep a separate sha1-cache independent of the git index\n<jelmer> and use that for bzr-git\n<lifeless> spiv:\n<lifeless> https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~spiv/testtools/test-parameterisation - might want to finish, or delete.\n<lifeless> \\o/ bzr selftest selftest working with testtools test runner\n<Peng> An autopack gave me an \"inconsistent details in skipped record\" message. \"bzr pack\" did not.

Only Bazaar branches are allowed.\n<jelmer> there are particular file names that are allowed\n<jelmer> I think backup.bzr* is allowed\n<jelmer> as well as .bzr\n<vila> yeah, the typo was backup.bzr~2~ instead of backup.bzr.~2~ after .bzr-broken was refused\n<vila> so the last period is mandatory\n<vila> jelmer: I had to upload a locally patched branch.conf to update the stacked-on repo :-/ After the upgrade failed successfully 8-/\n<jelmer> vila: \\o/\n<jelmer> vila: This is too hard for somebody not familiar with the internals though :-/\n<vila> jelmer: yeah, filing a bug asking for --stacked-on parameter for upgrade\n<vila> jelmer: exactly my point\n<jam> morning vila and jelmer\n<vila> hey jam 1\n<vila> how was the turkey ?\n<jam> pretty good\n<jelmer> hey John\n<jam> fun to be around my family\n<maxb> jelmer: hey. Got a moment to talk about how to run tests on a buildd and the 2.2.2 SRU?\n<jelmer> maxb: sure\n<maxb> The thing is, the 2.2.2 SRU as is doesn't pass the tests\n<maxb> The problem is the tests in 2.2 fail if they are run in a directory containing setup.py and run as root\n<jelmer> maxb: I don't think we should be introducing the change to run the tests in a SRU\n<vila> maxb: which ones ?\n<jelmer> maxb: I fixed the setup.py test a week or two ago in bzr.dev.\n<maxb> The one which tests 'setup.py install', and tries to write to /usr/share/apport/\n<maxb> This is not a problem in bzr.dev because I ripped out the apport installation from setup.py there with poolie's blessing\n<jelmer> maxb: Why did you remove the apport installation?\n<maxb> I can dig up the MP, but the summary is \"This is never the right thing to do - configuring apport is something for distros to do.\"\n<vila> maxb: I think this test should be skipped if run by root, sounds far too dangerous anyway\n<maxb> https://code.launchpad.net/~maxb/bzr/no-install-apport/+merge/38463\n<jelmer> maxb: Ah, ok. That's a reasonable approach (though it'd mean we'd have to patch bzr in Ubuntu)\n<maxb> vila: To be honest, I'm rather confused why this test is considered valuable at all\n<jelmer> maxb: Making sure that \"setup.py install\" works seems like a nice thing, it's broken in the past.\n<vila> maxb: catching up regressions\n<maxb> jelmer: The interesting fact to note is that the old apport installation code does *not* install the apport hooks in the bzr ubuntu package :-)\n<jelmer> maxb: https://code.launchpad.net/~jelmer/bzr/setup.py-root/+merge/40067\n<maxb> Oh, I get it now, you want to catch setup.py install failures in PQM\n<vila> maxb: which is why eager tests are bad :(\n<jelmer> maxb: But I guess that's been obsoleted by your change.\n<vila> maxb: I ran http://babune.ladeuil.net:24842/job/selftest-maverick/ this morning, but not as root, is it the only test failing ?\n<maxb> --root is more technically correct anyway\n<maxb> vila: checking for my ppa build log...\n<vila> meh, wrong url, the correct one is: http://babune.ladeuil.net:24842/job/selftest-maverick-proposed/\n<maxb> https://code.launchpad.net/~maxb/+archive/ppa/+build/2064150\n<vila> maxb: so I used the bzr from the bzr/proposed ppa\n<maxb> That buildlog shows just the one failure\n<maxb> Oh, you are testing the run-tests-when-installed part of the puzzle, I am focussing on the run-tests-on-buildd part of the puzzle\n<vila> maxb: yes\n<vila> maxb: my understanding was that we couldn't use python-testtools during the build so I reverted to the manual check\n<vila> oh, so you activate the tests in your private ppa (was wondering where I got my bzr-2.2.2 suddenly ;)\n<maxb> vila: I'm testing in ~maxb because ~bzr has a newer testtools than the primary archive, so wouldn't be a realistic test\n<maxb> Also, I am running the tests in ~bzr, but with some tweaks to how they are invoked in debian/rules, which I haven't managed to convince jelmer of the rightness of for Debian&Ubuntu yet.\n<bzr> Hi--I'm having some trouble with pushing from bzr explorer.

As I mentioned earlier, we've been running an 18month old project on bzr (migrated onto bzr about 8months ago) and so far have found xml merging quite nice... once we established everyone using tabs!\n<Tiriel> nice, that leaves me at ease.\n<Tiriel> On a totally different matter, is it possible to have some HTML code or something to pull the latest version of a file in bazaar and display it on a webpage\n<Tiriel> I don't really need the details, I just want to know if it's possible\n<peitschie_> bzr upload plugin?\n<mkanat> Tiriel: Depending on what you need, you could just use loggerhead.\n<peitschie_> that is helpful to push via ftp or similar\n<Tiriel> I really don't know what I need right now :(\n<Tiriel> I was thinking that I may want a website where the contents are grabbed from whatever is in bazaar\n<Tiriel> i.e. looking for the files in bazaar instead of /htdocs or whatever\n<Tiriel> maybe it is as easy as serving bazaar through apache and have the website look in there?\n<peitschie_> i'd b looking t bzr upload + cron job 4 that personally :)\n<Tiriel> as in pushing the head of bazaar's repo to the website with cron?\n<peitschie_> yup\n<Tiriel> Why would pushing from bazaar be better than pulling from the website?\n<Tiriel> not saying that pulling is better, just trying to understand your approach\n<peitschie_> brb :)\n<mkanat> Tiriel: Pushing wouldn't require a lot of work from bzr on every web hit.\n<mkanat> Tiriel: If you're talking about grabbing a file from a repo on every hit, that is.\n<Tiriel> Very good point, I hadn't thought of that\n<Tiriel> Also, by pushing we can control wich versions get published on the site!\n<Tiriel> and it is less coupled. WTF was I thinking!\n<Tiriel> Ok, I'm going to get some fresh air and settle the ideas, thanks to all\n<peitschie_> tiriel: pretty much my reasons match mkanat... less work to push it every once in a while than pull every web hit\n<Tiriel> yup, pushing does look like a much better idea, I hadn't thought it through\n<mkanat> Heyyy folks. :-) I need a review for this loggerhead merge: https://code.launchpad.net/~mkanat/loggerhead/view-default/+merge/42222\n<vila> maxb: qbzr and bzr-explorer needs to be upgraded in bzr/proposed right ?\n<maxb> ideally, yes\n<maxb> mkanat: Hi. The NEWS file on loggerhead trunk is incorrect, the top entry is under th 1.18 heading, but it actually only happened on trunk\n<mkanat> maxb: Oh yeah?

I've been asked to compile some stats on the lines of code changed every day for a code base.\n<johnf> The metric I've chosen at the moment is just using a diff -c on each commit and pushing that through diffstat\n<johnf> this tree is semi complex with lots of feature branches etc.\n<johnf> which diverge and then remerge\n<johnf> so for standard commits I think this is fine. But what about a commit that is a merge. Am I going to end up double counting changes?\n<vila> johnf: a commit including a merge will produce a diff against its left parent, so it will summarize all the diffs in the right parent(s) *and* whatever modifications made to resolve the conflicts\n<vila> it really depends on how you want to interpret the resulting stats and whether you drill down into the merges...\n<johnf> vila: yeah not the simplest task I've ever been given.\n<vila> johnf: if you don't use append_revions_only then it becomes even more.... interesting\n<johnf> At the moment I'm tempted to ignore the merge revisions in my stats and assume that conflict changes were small\n<vila> one could argue that a merge commit is more work than a regular one though...\n<johnf> vila: Yeah agree but I don't see any easy way to avoid the double counting\n<vila> may be you shouldn't avoid it\n<vila> that's why I said it depends on what you want to interpret, I'm not sure the raw numbers are meaningful, but how they evolve over time may be more meaningful\n<vila> maxb, jelmer: qbzr and bzr-explorer should be upgraded in debian first or can we update the bzr/proposed ppa directly ?\n<vila> both debian and the ppas are at qbzr-0.19.2-1 and we want 0.19.3 and for bzr-explorer that's 1.1.0 /1.1.2\n<jelmer> vila: hi\n<vila> jelmer: hey :)\n<jelmer> vila: it'd be nice to upgrade debian first, but it's not necessary\n* vila changed the topic of #bzr to: Bazaar version control | try https://answers.launchpad.net/bzr for more help | http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/ | Patch pilot: jam | 2.2.2 is out <http://bit.ly/bzr222rn> (rm vila)\n<vila> maxb: so, should we start the SRU with bug #659590 or do you still have pending changes regarding running the tests during build (or not) ?\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 659590 in bzr (Ubuntu) \"dput sftp upload hangs after all files successfully uploaded (affected: 1, heat: 72)\" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/659590\n<maxb> vila: I have pending changes\n<maxb> Hmm\n<maxb> Except\n<vila> maxb: ok, so we shouldn't copy the package from proposed to stable either right ?\n<vila> maxb: no pressure, just trying to know where we are\n<maxb> If we are now decided to *not* run the testsuite on the official buildd, the unresolved discussion between me and jelmer on how to run it does not matter.\n<maxb> Thus, I should back out the \"run testsuite during build\" changes from the sru branch\n<maxb> On the matter of the bzr/proposed package, I regard that as OK to promote\n<vila> maxb: that's how I read the reply from pitti regarding MRE/SRU: run the tests after installation\n<maxb> The indecision remains only on the manner of how to run tests during build\n<vila> maxb: ok, so I just copy the bzr one and qbzr and bzr-explorer will be upgraded later\n<maxb> works for me\n<vila> maxb: where is that defined ?

If I do 'bzr log --show-ids -v -l1 bzr' in both branches (sru and bzr-ppa), I have the same file-ids\n<maxb> vila: Correct\n<maxb> Now do it in lp:ubuntu/maverick/bzr and see the difference\n<vila> parallel import is about having different file-ids for the same paths AIUI\n<maxb> Yes\n<vila> oh\n<vila> ouch\n<vila> maxb: ok, I won't look at that today then :-/\n<maxb> vila: Sorry, what?\n<maxb> AFAIK the next job is making 2.3b4 land in natty\n<maxb> not anything to do with the branches\n<vila> maxb: right, I was referring to the parallel import bugs :)\n<vila> maxb: 2.3b4 is next Thursday\n<maxb> ok, that's not too bad\n<abentley> jam, do you still feel you need info on https://code.launchpad.net/~abentley/bzr/is_executable/+merge/42197?  Do you want me to make a more conservative change?\n<RenatoSilva> does the last part of revid (like xirl6fr0zipbof4h) is a unique identifier?\n<RenatoSilva> I want to add binaries to the branch with namestelling what exact revision they match\n<maxb> That was quite impatient\n<vila> :)\n<jam> abentley: there are a couple of bits. I mostly was hoping to get discussion from others about what is \"stable api\". But also, I'm not sure whether None isn't more accurate a term for executable on symlinks and directories\n<jam> from what I can see, WT and RT both return None\n<jam> and PreviewTree returns what is in the basis tree\n<jam> MemoryTree is the only one that always returns IE.executable, which defaults to Falso\n<jam> False\n<abentley> jam, no, it's only RT according to the per-tree tests I introduced.\n<jam> abentley: your branch also changed WT\n<jam> at least, WT_4\n<abentley> jam, My branch also changed DirStateRevisionTree.\n<jam> ah\n<abentley> jam, None is also inconsistent with our other APIs.\n<jam> right, WT.is_executable returns bool(<is_file> and S_IEXEC)\n<jam> abentley: the fact that most directories have the X bit set, but are \"False\" for executable seemed odd to me\n<abentley> jam, RT._comparison_data says False, not None for RT.\n<abentley> jam, On directories, that bit means they can be searched.  It doesn't mean that they're executable.\n<abentley> jam, IMO, directories and symlinks are never, themselves, executable, because they're not files, and you can't execute things that aren't files.\n<vila> abentley, jam: I'm very tempted to say that if dirs and symlinks are never executable, then executable should not even been *defined* for them, we don't define symlink target for files or directories either. But since that would be far more invasive to get there, I think None is more precise than False to convey \"never\"\n<vila> s/been/be/ ?\n<jam> vila: that was sort of my feeling as well. that said, False does seem a bit more consistent with the current implementations.\n<jam> the fact that IE.executable is defaulted do False, etc\n<abentley> vila: I don't see value in having a tri-value where a boolean will do.  There is only one answer to the question \"can this be executed\"?  And there's no value I can see to a programmer, expecially since None is not clearly distinct from False.\n<vila> there is a value is using None to mean: this make no sense\n<vila> using False implies True is valid\n<abentley> vila: What is the value?  How will this aid my bzrlib programming?  And does the value offset the cost of having to deal with a third potential return value, and the inability to treat the value as a boolean?\n<vila> I don't see the value in having a boolean where none is needed either, at least 'None' carries this\n<vila> It helps to see None more than to see False as you could then realize that is_executable shouldn't be defined for a dir or a symlink whereas a newcomer may wonder: 'Wait, it's False, when will it be True ?'\n<vila> And *that* AIUI is why executability changes were wrongly triggered\n<abentley> vila: I am saying boolean values are easier for calling code to deal with.  They can be used in conditionals directly.  They can be serialized using standard machinery.\n<abentley> When were executability changes wrongly triggered?  do you mean in the incremental diffs?\n<vila> wow, wow, what are you talking about here ? All the code exist to handle this *today* no ?\n<vila> isn't it what the bug you're fixing about ?\n<abentley> vila: No, I think a lot of the code that exists today treats it as a boolean, and mostly gets away with it.\n<abentley> vila: The PreviewTree code treated it as a boolean, and that's the cause of the incremental diff problems.\n<vila> so all is left to decide is whether None is better than False because we won't un-implement is_executable for dirs and symlinks\n<vila> then why not teach this code that is_executable can be None ?\n<abentley> vila: Because a) it's the wrong value b) implementing that decision everywhere would be a lot of code and API changes.\n<vila> I can understand that it's *easier* to fix it the way you did, but saying that False == None is a bit... different\n<abentley> vila: who's saying False == None?\n<vila> you\n<vila> executable is never defined for dirs/symlinks, you implement it as False\n<abentley> vila: Most assuredly not.  If I tell you that a directory is executable, is that a true statement or a false statement?\n<vila> MU :D\n<abentley> vila: No, it's not MU.  Even if you argue that the state of a directory's executability is undefined, my statement is false.\n<vila> well, if you agree that your statement is false, then all is well :)\n<abentley> vila: Indeed, because that means that directories are not executable, and the answer to the question \"is this directory executable\" is \"false\".\n<abentley> vila: It's not a question of \"has the executability of this directory been  toggled to the False state\", it's a question of \"can this directory be executed\".\n<abentley> vila: In any case, I hold that a two-value system is less complicated than a three-value system, and therefore in the absence of clear evidence that a three-value system provides a superior API, I believe we should opt for a two-value system.\n<vila> ha ! That's more convincing, between a zero values (no implementation for dirs/symlinks), 2 or 3 values, then yes, the 2 values being less expensive than the 0 one, let's do that !\n<abentley> vila: yay!\n<sqwishy> In bazaar, is there a nice way to destroy the history of a file without making your branch messed up and incompatible?\n<dash> sqwishy: first, build a time machine\n<sqwishy> dash: Do you know which channel I could go to to get help with that?\n<dash> sqwishy: there was a time traveler convention at MIT, 7 May 2005\n<dash> sqwishy: you might try there/then\n<dash> sqwishy: anyway no, you can't change history\n<dash> (unless you do it the hard way)\n<jelmer> well, technically bazaar supports having a file without history\n<jelmer> in other words, the history would still exist.. the repository just would just forget about it\n<jelmer> (note that this is different from changing history, which is not possible)\n<poolie> hi all\n<poolie> hi jam?\n<jam> hi poolie\n<poolie> hi there\n<poolie> vila is just talking to me, then we could talk if you like\n<jam> vila: go to bed :)\n<vila> jam: hehe, soon soon\n<poolie> vila, so shall we do 2.3b4 this week?\n<vila> given that we need to do that to comply with the SRU policy that will allow us to release 2.2.2 into maverick-proposed, yes :D\n<vila> also, 'rmadison bzr' says that natty only got 2.3b2 so there is something to be done there too\n<poolie> work out where it's stalling\n<vila> jam: by the way, did you see bug #683307, I wonder if there is an lp bug there (I haven't checked but it's weird to have another mx recursion depth )\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 683307 in Bazaar \"Bazaar crashes on push (affected: 1, heat: 6)\" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/683307\n<jam> vila: that is stacking-on-self-causes infinite recursion\n<poolie> i thought so\n<jam> I've seen 3 of those in the last couple of days, not sure why\n<vila> jam: that's my point, especially since for the previous two ones you found an almost empty branch.conf on lp\n<vila> jam: if the third has the same file...\n<jam> vila: there isn't really a reason to have anything else there.\n<jam> I don't know if people are renaming\n<jam> or creating the dev focus first\n<jam> or we have a regression with the \"don't stack on self if self is the default target\"\n<poolie> that's possible\n<poolie> we should trap this and give a sensible warning\n<vila> poolie: regarding bug #583667, I think we're not on the same page, I mentioned BZR_LP_XMLRPC_URL only for xmlrpc usages,\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 583667 in Bazaar 2.3 \"bzr talks to edge API servers to propose merges (but not for lp: url lookups) (affected: 1, heat: 10)\" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/583667\n<vila> I should clarify that it doesn't apply to launchpadlib for which there is no env var\n<vila> poolie: would this address your concerns ?\n<poolie> if setting that variable will fix older clients (including older lplib) then that's fine\n<poolie> hm, scratch that\n<poolie> i think putting this in the bzr news is the wrong place\n<poolie> perhaps we should put a post on blog.l.n, or append to that post\n<jam> vila: interesting, tart-sleepymate is correct, but the branch it is stacked on is broken\n<jam> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~sleepynate/tart/tart-sleepynate/.bzr/branch/branch.conf\n<jam> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~andreesie/tart/vanilla/.bzr/branch/branch.conf\n<poolie> saying, for bzr, you need to either upgrade to 2.0.8, 2.1.x, etc\n<jam> vila: I wonder if the +branch/ change to bzr+ssh is confusing us\n<poolie> or, set BZR_LP_XMLRPC_URL\n<jam> so that we see the stacking location as +branch/tart at one point, but end up setting it to ~/andreesie/tart/vanilla at another point\n<poolie> and we need to check whether setting that will fix all interactions with lp, or only lp: urls\n<jam> thumper: ^^ some questions about your changes to the lp: resolution stuff\n<poolie> lifeless: ^^\n<lifeless> hmm?\n<jam> lifeless: I think poolie is pointing you to the BZR_LP_XMLRPC_URL stuff\n<lifeless> whats that for?\n<lifeless> users have no use case for controlling the end point;

I wonder if we are reading in the entire old pack file to compute the md5sum...\n<jam> hi spiv\n<jam> spiv: I wanted to ask you about https://code.launchpad.net/~spiv/bzr/fetch-spec-everything-not-in-other/+merge/42078\n<spiv> jam: Today I'm planning to work on the hpss request you suggested in your shallow branching mail.\n<jam> it says you changed the description, but it doesn't show a delta\n<jam> I was wondering what the different was\n<spiv> I typoed the bug number\n<jam> bbiab, my son is asking for me\n<spiv> So, nothing significant :)\n<poolie> hi there spiv\n<CardinalFang> Hi.  Is anyone else running Natty right now?  I'd like an independent test of something.\n<CardinalFang> Namely, I want to know if there's a problem with plugin \"bzr-builddeb\".\n<CardinalFang> $ bzr branch lp:debian/python-couchdb 0.8-0u1; cd 0.8-0u1; bzr import-upstream 0.8 http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/C/CouchDB/CouchDB-0.8.tar.gz\n<CardinalFang> At crash location, there's a comment mentioning spiv's tags-copied-but-no-revisions bug, but I think it's not related.\n<maxb> CardinalFang: Not running natty. Will maverick + tip of bzr-builddeb do?\n<spiv> CardinalFang: pastebin the crash maybe?\n<CardinalFang> maxb, I don't know.  If you get AttributeError ^, you'd know.\n<CardinalFang> spiv, I shouldn't have woken you.  I've decided your bug isn't related at all.\n<spiv> CardinalFang: also, see if \"bzr tags\" in that branch reports ? rather than revnos\n<spiv> (in the local branch)\n<maxb> bzr: ERROR: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/C/CouchDB/CouchDB-0.8.tar.gz'\n<maxb> for me\n<spiv> CardinalFang: well, even if it isn't that bug, seeing the traceback will help us figure out what the bug is :)\n<maxb> CardinalFang: No AttributeError here when I download the file locally. However, this sounds vaguely like a bug recently fixed in trunk\n<CardinalFang> stack trace:  http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/538464/\n<CardinalFang> spiv, all tags have revnos.\n<spiv> Ok, that rules out the tag bug.\n<CardinalFang> bzr = 2.3.0~beta2-1;  brz-builddeb = 2.6ubuntu1\n<spiv> CardinalFang: I'm guessing it's because bzr-builddeb is looking for an upstream branch, but doesn't know of one...\n<spiv> It's worth filing a bug on bzr-builddeb, I think.\n<maxb> No, it's fixed in trunk r485\n<spiv> maxb: ah!\n<spiv> maxb: heh, my local copy of trunk was at 484 :)\n * CardinalFang looks for bzr nightlies.\n<maxb> bzr branch lp:bzr-builddeb :-)\n<spiv> There's also https://launchpad.net/~bzr-nightly-ppa/+archive\n<spiv> Oh, actually, that's not the PPA I was thinking of..\n<spiv> https://launchpad.net/~jelmer/+archive/bzr-dailies is the one I was thinking of.\n<CardinalFang> Rock.\n<maxb> no, that's obsolete too\n<maxb> You want https://launchpad.net/~bzr/+archive/daily\n<maxb> (spiv, CardinalFang)\n<spiv> maxb: heh\n<CardinalFang> maxb, spiv, thank you very much.  I owe you a beer.\n<spiv> maxb: Hmm, I guess the link to bzr-nightly-ppa on https://launchpad.net/bzr should be replaced with that, then?\n<peitschie> mornin all :)\n<poolie> hi there\n<abentley> poolie: I discussed the branch with jam, but things got derailed into a discussion over what the philosophically-correct return value is when calling is_executable on a directory.\n<poolie> oh, ok\n<poolie> False vs None vs error?\n<abentley> poolie: False vs None.\n<abentley> poolie: I think False is correct, but I think consistency is the most important consideration.\n<abentley> poolie: And False is also consistent with other Tree types and other RevisionTree APIs.  Changing it all to None would be a big change.\n<maxb> spiv: Based on the utter deadness of where it currently points, I've just gone ahead and updated it right now\n<james_w> thanks maxb\n<spiv> maxb: thanks :)\n<poolie> abentley: so is it stuck? would you like another review?\n<abentley> poolie: So landing in 2.2 is stuck.  Another review would be helpful.\n<abentley> poolie: https://code.launchpad.net/~abentley/bzr/is_executable/+merge/42197\n<poolie> that one, or the one that supersedes it?\n<abentley> poolie: That one.  The one that supsersedes it is for trunk.\n<poolie> thanks for the incremental diffs btw\n<abentley> poolie: You're welcome.\n<jelmer> hi James, Poolie, Spiv, Aaron, Max\n<jelmer> spiv: My daily builds are mostly living under ~bzr now\n<jelmer> nevermind, I see Max already mentioned that\n<poolie> :)\n<james_w> hi jelmer\n<abentley> jelmer: Hi.\n<poolie> abentley: what was the old behaviour?\n<poolie> oh, None?\n<abentley> poolie: yes.\n<poolie> fairly obviously\n<mkanat> Hey hey. Anybody available to do a review on a loggerhead merge proposal?\n<mkanat> https://code.launchpad.net/~mkanat/loggerhead/view-default/+merge/42222\n<mkanat> thumper: Would you be the person to talk to about that, now? :-)\n<maxb> jelmer: Hi, a question. Why are the bzr daily recipes using version numbers like 1.4.0~bzr{revno}~ppa{revno:packaging}+{revno:debian} ? The ordering of {revno:packaging} and {revno:debian} is inverted to what feels natural to me?\n<poolie> hi mkanat\n<mkanat> Hey poolie! :-)\n<poolie> maxb: i agree\n<poolie> abentley: i replied; on the whole it seems like a good change but some testing wbn\n<poolie> perhaps we should do that within hudson\n<poolie> or just manually\n<abentley> poolie: What kind of testing do you have in mind?\n<thumper> mkanat: hmm\n<thumper> mkanat: I'm not entirely sure\n<thumper> mkanat: poke poolie :)\n<mkanat> thumper: Hahaha, okay. :-)\n<mkanat> poolie: So, any thoughts on who can do my loggerhead review there?\n<mkanat> poolie: Or do you just want me to check it in w/o review? (Not sure how comfortable I am about that, although I have tested it.)\n<poolie> i probably could\n<abentley> poolie: In the cover letter I said \"This branch fixes RevisionTree.is_executable to treat directories and symlinks the same way as other Tree implementations-- to return False rather than None.\"  Was that not a clear enough statement?\n<poolie> sorry, you did\n<poolie> perhaps it is worth mentioning in news though\n<poolie> is this going to systematically change what's returned by iter_changes in non-test cases?\n<poolie> mkanat: shall we discuss it in #launchpad-dev?\n<mkanat> poolie: Sure, I'm there now.\n<abentley> poolie: I believe only PreviewTree, because only PreviewTree can use RevisionTree.is_executable in its  it only changes iter_changes when it involves PreviewTree, because only PreviewTree uses is_executable to implement Tree._comparison_data.\n<abentley> poolie: I believe only PreviewTree, because only PreviewTree can use RevisionTree.is_executable in its _comparison_data implementation.\n<abentley> So only iter_changes on PreviewTrees should be affected.\n<poolie> so i'd comfortably +1 it now if you could run the tests of the relevant plugins\n<poolie> that might be a bit annoying if the test suites are not obviously clean to start with though\n#bzr 2010-12-01\n<abentley> poolie: by \"relevant plugins\" do you mean ones that do iter_changes on PreviewTrees, or ones that might do RevisionTree.is_executable, or...?\n<poolie> im' not sure if it will be easy to identify which ones could be affected\n<poolie> we could guess based on the apis\n<poolie> or just test the ones that are packaged\n<abentley> poolie: I don't think it will be easy.\n<abentley> poolie: Okay, I'll go find out what's packaged and make sure I've got it all installed, and then run the plugin tests.\n<poolie> do you think this is too laborious and we should just land it?\n<poolie> i think it would be worth at least just running them\n<poolie> if it turns out they're too noisy, then we could decide what to do\n<abentley> poolie: I think I can run them and delta the test failures against vanila 2.2.\n<poolie> that sounds good to me if that works for you\n<poolie> so to keep this under control as a contract\n<poolie> i think i should mark out what we want in each particular future release\n<poolie> would that work for youL\n<poolie> mkanat: actually just generally, feel free to request review from me, jam, spiv, or all of ~bzr\n<mkanat> poolie: Okay.\n<mkanat> mwhudson: If I make the change about the None, do you want me to re-request review or just go ahead and merge it after doing it?\n<mwhudson> mkanat: if you're confident in your change, just merge it\n<mkanat> mwhudson: Okay.\n<mkanat> mwhudson: I'm also wondering if there might be an off-by-one error in the contents array, so that it has an extra line that it shouldn't have.\n<mwhudson> seems a bit unlikely somehow\n<mkanat> mwhudson: Well, I think that annotate_iter may not consider a final \"\\n\" to be adding an extra line.\n<mwhudson> oh right maybe\n<mkanat> So I suppose I could just have the generator create an infinite number of empty containers at the end.\n<mkanat> Since we iterate over the contents array now instead.\n<mwhudson> that works i guess\n<mkanat> I think it'd be the simplest solution, code-wise.\n<mkanat> Well, launchpad outage stops me from doing any more development or merging. :-(\n<jdobrien> is there an issue with launchpad right now?\n<mwhudson> jdobrien: one of the data centres is offline\n<jdobrien> mwhudson, aha! that would answer it\n<jdobrien> mwhudson, I hope it was planned :o\n<AfC> mkanat: why would the lack of availability of a centralized web resource have anything to do with you being able to get work done with a distributed revision control system like Bazaar?\n<abentley> poolie: I've run all plugin tests, and none fail with is_executable that pass with 2.2.  Actually, an extra fails with 2.2, so I assume it's a flaky test.\n<mkanat> AfC: Because my code exists only on LP right now, I reverted my patch locally.\n<poolie> abentley: nice\n<abentley> poolie: shall I go ahead and land it on 2.2, then?\n<poolie> please do\n<abentley> poolie: btw, I looked up who committed this code that's causing me grief.  It was me.\n<poolie> haha :)\n<poolie> thanks for persisting with fixing it\n<abentley> poolie: no worries.\n<poolie> mkanat: reading your patch now\n<mkanat> poolie: Okay.\n<poolie> done!\n<poolie> good to go\n<mkanat> poolie: Thanks! Good timing by me. :-)\n<mkanat> poolie: BTW, I'm on the launchpad-devel mailing list still, so I do get the messages even if they're not CC'ed to me. (I usually just watch for subjects about loggerhead or codebrowse.)\n<mkanat> poolie: There is a test framework in place, BTW.\n<poolie> k\n<poolie> ... but it's hard to use for this?\n<mkanat> poolie: No, not that hard, I could do it. But I think it mostly already covers this, since annotate is already tested...I believe.\n<mkanat> Yeah, annotate is already tested.\n<poolie> it seems like if you're changing the default view\n<poolie> and the tests don't fail\n<poolie> there must be a gap in coverage?\n<mkanat> poolie: I haven't run the tests, because they're failing anyway. :-)\n<poolie> really, just generally? :/\n<mkanat> poolie: Well, they were last time I ran them.\n<poolie> to the extent that it's not worth adding a new one?\n<mkanat> poolie: Ah, no, it could be worth adding a new one. Let me get the tests running on my new system (I just upgraded my OS and am missing some packages) and I'll see how much work it would be.\n<poolie> well, it could be worth a try\n<mkanat> I'm not quite figuring out why the tests won't run on my machine. Maybe it's some python 2.7 thing.\n<poolie> what os do you use?\n<spiv> mkanat: hmm, IIRC bzr's tests are fine on 2.7 now.\n<mkanat> poolie: Fedora\n<mkanat> spiv: Yeah, but these are loggerhead's tests.\n<mkanat> I seem to recall just being able to \"nosetests\" on python 2.6 and things would be fine.\n<mkanat> jam, mwhudson: Do you know what it takes to get the loggerhead tests to run right?\n<jam> mkanat: at one point I tried to integrate it with \"bzr selftest -s bp.loggerhead\"\n<mkanat> jam: Ohh, right. Since then, I think the tests have been broken with nosetests.\n<mkanat> jam: So I have to have it symlinked in as a plugin to do that, right?\n<jam> something like that, yes\n<mkanat> AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '_WritelnDecorator'\n<mkanat> Are bzr's tests only working with python 2.7 on trunk?\n<mkanat> I have 2.2.1 installed.\n<poolie> mkanat: probably yes\n<mkanat> Okay.\n<poolie> there's no py26 in fedora 14(?)\n<mkanat> poolie: Right.\n<spiv> I run bzr trunk's tests with 2.6 all the time.\n<spiv> Perhaps you need a newer testtools or something like that?\n<mkanat> spiv: No, I just easy_install'ed it.\n<mkanat> This is the traceback: http://pastie.org/1337546\n<mkanat> It's pretty apparent that it's just related to the unittest changes in 2.7.\n<poolie> mm\n<poolie> you might be able to cherrypick-back the changes from 2.3 to fix it?\n<poolie> or perhaps testing it against bzr 2.3 is still useful\n<mkanat> Ah, well, I don't imagine LP runs 2.3.\n<mkanat> I'll have to figure out how to make these tests work with nosetests again.\n<mkanat> Wow, how is this SO FAST? Probably because of crazy custom Hg implementation. http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/source/list\n<poolie> that's what we should aim for\n<mkanat> Yeah.\n<poolie> might need more than little slices of time though :/\n<mkanat> I think we'd have to actually cache the rendered HTML to get that fast.\n<mkanat> But maybe not.\n<poolie> perhaps an intermediate representation is cached\n<poolie> they're probably not touching a magnetic disk to have it consistently that fast\n<lifeless> that sort of speed is what cassandra is aimed at\n<lifeless> - its a bigtable backend for hg\n<mkanat> poolie: Well, if it's anything like their Svn implementation, it's a mapreduce thing with, yeah, bigtable.\n<mkanat> First off we'd have to figure out what and how to cache things.\n<mkanat> Although if you had a cassandra backend for bzr, we may not even have to cache them, I don't know for sure.\n<lifeless> you'd denormalise things like revnos\n<lifeless> in a sense such a thing is a cache\n<mkanat> Right, we already have a revno cache in loggerhead.\n<lifeless> if we can finish the 'does not need vfs for regular use' work, we could seriously consider a cassandra impl\n<lifeless> failing that we could push (thus limiting the operations that take place) into a ro cassandra mirror\n<poolie> using hpss to talk to a process that talks to cassandra?\n<poolie> oh nm, yes\n<lifeless> yes, exactly.\n<mkanat> jam: Do you know why your changes would have caused this (when trying to run the loggerhead tests via nosetests)? http://pastie.org/1337584\n<jam> mkanat: not specifically, but I know that loggerhead doesn't know whether it is a plugin or a main script, and does some ugly hacks with the python import path to try and work both ways\n<mkanat> jam: Ah, yeah.\n<mkanat> poolie: It's probably going to take me quite some time to get the test suite working again, just as far as figuring out what's wrong and making things work right again. Do you still want me to add a test for the new controller?\n<spiv> mkanat: I'm not poolie, but I think investing in the test suite will pay off\n<mkanat> spiv: I fully and completely agree with you; this is more of a \"how does Canonical want me to spend my hours\" sort of a deal. :-)\n<poolie> mkanat: let's not block this merge on that, but i do think it would be worth spending some canonical time on it\n<mkanat> poolie: Okay.\n<mkanat> Sounds good.\n<poolie> it seems like it will help do other work in future\n<mkanat> poolie: Okay, agreed.\n<lifeless> it would be good to switch it to using testtools.run rather than nosetests\n<lifeless> which will give it easy hudson integration via subunit.run\n<mkanat> lifeless: It can already run under bzr selftest, I just can't run bzr selftest using my version of bzr and my version of Python.\n<lifeless> mkanat: why not? actually scratch that question. Different one: perhaps fixing that is more important.\n<mkanat> lifeless: Supposedly that's been fixed on trunk, just not in 2.2.x.\n<mkanat> lifeless: (This is with python 2.7.)\n<mkanat> So, TAL is not a very good template language. :-(\n<bob2> the chameleon implementation is nicer\n<bob2> gives you $foo for when you're feeling lazy\n<mkanat> Yeah, it's not so much the convenience of not of the language, as much as it is that it's just very difficult to work out how to do certain things.\n<mkanat> Particularly if you can't wrap an element in another element, or don't want to.\n<mkanat> I really liked Mako last time I used it, that's probably what I'd prefer, although I have no idea if there are any serious problems with it in production (or if it's still actively maintained).\n<vila> hello all !\n<vila> full red babune\n<vila> I upgraded to testtools trunk yesterday, direct link, url: http://babune.ladeuil.net:24842/job/selftest-maverick/lastFailedBuild/\n<vila> Nice tests as only reading their names strongly suggests a shallow problem\n<mkanat> I could do template inheritance with my patch that I'm working on right now, too, if I was using Mako instead. :-/\n<vila> lifeless, jml: bug #683505 rings a bell regarding a recent change in testtools ?\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 683505 in Bazaar \"bzrlib.tests.test_selftest.TestSubunitLogDetails failures with testtools trunk (affected: 1, heat: 6)\" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/683505\n<vila> mgz: may also be related to a too aggressive cleanup of the test details ? ^\n<vila> jml, lifeless: ping\n<vila> testtools introduced a change in revno 142 (regarding the return value of running a test suite with failing or erroring test),\n<vila> I'd like to guard against that by testing the testtools version\n<vila> I can use 0.9.8 for that except if you expect to change the behavior again before releasing 0.9.8\n<vila> jml, lifeless: when do you expect to release 0.9.8 ?\n<lifeless> vila: its going to be backed out, see the bug\n<vila> lifeless: rats, too bad I missed that one, this sounded like a nice change though\n<lifeless> only part of the patch is buggy\n<lifeless> only that bit will be backed out\n<lifeless> it breaks subunit too\n<vila> Ok, I'll subscribe to the bug to see how it goes then\n<vila> meh, lp already subscribed me :)\n<vila> I'll revert my babune testtools in the mean time\n<vila> dOxxx: Hey !\n<dOxxx> vila: hey :)\n<dOxxx> vila: everything go okay with the release?\n<vila> dOxxx: Thanks for the reviews and merges !

Hmm, more tricks coming :)\n<vila> maxb: I just do a debchange/debcommit/debuild -S/dput dance\n<maxb> but don't you have this in a bzr branch?\n<vila> maxb: I do\n<maxb> \"bzr mark-uploaded\" is \"bzr tag <figure it out from the changelog>\"\n<vila> hmm, done\n<maxb> yay :-)\n<vila> pushed\n<vila> so the branch lacks a proper tag for the previous version, but we can forget about that right ?\n<vila> I should do the same in the hardy branch though\n<vila> or should I create 1.0.0hardy1 first to catch up ?\n<vila> OMG that's why ubuntu version follow the alphabet ?\n<jam> sometimes I wonder what the Unicode people are smoking: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f63c/index.htm\n<jam> \"Unicode Character 'CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE'\"\n<vila> maxb: ^ ?\n<maxb> Yes that is one of the reasons for ubuntu versions following the alphabet :-)\n<vila> maxb: cool :) And about creating a 1.0.0hardy1 version ?\n<maxb> There is no particular need to do 1.0.0hardy1, I would call the hardy branch the 'trunk' and let it use plain version numbers\n<vila> ok\n<radix> jam: FINALLY I've been wanting that codepoint for *ages*\n<maxb>   File \"/home/maxb/wc/bzr/qbzr/ppa/karmic/lib/tests/modeltest.py\", line 69, in nonDestructiveBasicTest\n<maxb>     assert(self.model.columnCount(QtCore.QModelIndex()) >= 0)\n<maxb> TypeError: QAbstractItemModel.columnCount() is abstract and cannot be called as an unbound method\n<maxb> Anyone qbzr-involved around who can interpret that?\n<maxb> The current qbzr packaging turns on the tests on the buildds, and it fails like that for karmic\n<maxb> I am now wondering if anyone actually uses qbzr from the ppa on karmic\n<maxb> or jaunty even\n<vila> gary gary where are you ??? garyvdm (hoping to trigger a curl/grep daemon)\n<vila> maxb: this smells like a qt dependency, filing  a bug on qbzr may be your best bet\n<vila> mgz, jam: What will happend if bzr selftest has to access to the TEMP dir ?\n<vila> d for devil\n<vila> mgz, jam: in windows that is\n<jam> vila: if it has to, then it will access it...\n<jam> I don't quite understand your question\n<jam> are you wondering *where* temp is?\n<vila> it turns out babune has no write access (nor read even) to TEMP (c:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP)\n<vila> yet most of the tests pass... So I wonder how :D\n<jam> are you sure $TEMP isn't C:\\Documents and Settings\\<user>\\Application Data\\Local\\Temp ?\n<jam> check what\n<jam> tempfile.mkstemp() returns\n<vila> nothing :-DF\n<vila> ha, no typo of course\n<vila> c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tpmxxxx\n<jam> or tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile().name\n<vila> blink\n<jam> vila: are you *sure* it doesn't have access :)\n<jam> I'm not sure the protection model for winxp, but it may be impossible to block the standard temp dir, or something\n<vila> that's weird, if I set TEMP to  a dir I create myself the offending test pass\n<vila> jam: right, it has access, but... something goes wrong just for this test...\n<jam> we use $TEMP for the whole test suite, so I would be surprised if that was the specific failure\n<jam> maybe the path depth is getting too long?\n<vila> no, simple file name\n<jam> (more than 260 chars?)\n<vila> and my test dir is longer than windows/temp\n<vila> right, and from a cygwin shell TEMP is set as you said and the test pass\n<vila> so definitely some weird user setup, I fixed some, but more is needed, but enough for tonight, probably the ssh server fail to setuid properly, I may have to tweak the service definition and reboot or something-ish :)\n<poolie> hi jam, spiv\n<jam> hi poolie\n<poolie> jam, join #ubuntu-meeting?\n<dOxxx> I return!\n<jelmer> \\o/\n<dOxxx> so the eventual decision was that the installer for bzr 2.2.2 should include subvertpy 0.7.5 and bzr-svn 1.0.5?\n<jelmer> dOxxx: I don't remember releasing 1.0.5 :-)\n<jelmer> dOxxx: but other than that, yes.\n<dOxxx> (09:34:48) vila: so, bzr-svn 1.0.5 is targeted at 2.x for x in [0,1,2,3] :)\n<dOxxx> did he mean 1.0.4?\n<jelmer> dOxxx: no, 1.0.5 is in development at the moment\n<dOxxx> ah\n<dOxxx> um\n<dOxxx> jelmer: So, just to be sure, bzr-svn 1.0.4 should be bzr 2.2 compatible, right?\n<maxb> jelmer: speaking of which, when are you going to release 1.0.5 :-)\n<maxb> Would be nice to get those kde code imports that are currently being imported by my desktop on to launchpad proper\n<poolie> jam, hi, still around?\n<jelmer> maxb: I don't have any immediate plans, would like to get those ghost issues resolved first.\n<jelmer> maxb: It should be possible to cherrypick the new release for launchpad though, new bzr-svn releases have to be cherrypicked anyway.\n<maxb> jelmer: cherrypick as in merge just the relevant fixes into the ~launchpad-pqm branch?\n<jam> poolie: yeah, I'm still here\n<jelmer> maxb: No, sorry - I used the wrong word. I meant to say new bzr-svn releases have to be merged manually for lp anyway.\n<poolie> sorry otp at the moment\n<maxb> yes... but that is dependent on there being a new upstream release first :-)\n<jam> np, you were looking for me :)\n<jelmer> maxb: not really, we've merged snapshots in the past.\n<maxb> So I should review whether there's a comfortable point on lp:bzr-svn/1.0 which we can be happy about using\n<jelmer> maxb: Yes; hopefully that will be trip.\n<jelmer> *tip\n<vila> dOxxx: if 1.0.5 is not released, it's ok to put it in 2.3, hoping for jelmer to release it before 2.3 is final, for 2.2, we should stau with officially released versions, so 1.04, sory for the confusion, I was looking at the source in bzr-mac-installer/2.3/src/bzr-svn\n<vila> s/stau/stay/\n * vila off to bed ;)\n<peitschie> nite vila\n<peitschie> (mornin jelmer, poolie, jam, maxb, dOxxx... woah.. busy today!)\n<poolie> bye vila\n<maxb> Does anyone know what the graph.sh in hydrazine is intended to be used with?\n<maxb> Because the data collection part of the puzzle appears to be missing\n<maxb> I am wondering if we should delete graph.sh from hydrazine\n<maxb> (poolie perhaps?)\n<_habnabit> Is there a thing anyone knows of that visualizes branching and merging?\n<dash> _habnabit: 'bzr qlog'\n<dash> or 'bzr vis'\n<_habnabit> Aha.\n<dash> depending on if you have the qt or gtk plugins installed\n<_habnabit> Apparently I have neither.\n<maxb> I recommend qlog. Even though I am a GNOME user.\n<maxb> qlog is just too shiny not to use, even if I have to install all of Qt to do it\n<_habnabit> Is there something that can spit out a dot file, maybe?\n<poolie> maxb, it's pretty old, i think we should delete it\n<poolie> if the collection code is checked in at all, it will be there\n<poolie> it never got to a super useful state though\n<poolie> i thought there was a count-bugs.py or something?\n<maxb> There is, but it emits human-readable text, not rrd anything\n<spiv> _habnabit: there is somewhere\n<spiv> _habnabit: the graph-ancestry command from bzrtools\n<_habnabit> Aha.\n#bzr 2010-12-02\n<spiv> _habnabit: qlog/vis are nicer than the dot output, I think :)\n<_habnabit> It's still churning away at making the dot output.\n<spiv> _habnabit: churning away in the graph-ancestry command, or in dot?\n<spiv> I wouldn't expect graph-ancestry to need much time, but I would expect dot could be challenged by a large graph.\n<_habnabit> dot was being slow.\n<_habnabit> I'm also building python at the same time.\n<poolie> \\o spiv\n<_habnabit> Also this dot output is pretty sweet\n<_habnabit> It really just shows merges, which is what I wanted\n<_habnabit> I don't care about individual revisions\n<poolie> maxb: you legend\n<maxb> I'm not sure I deserve that just for deleting some cruft :-)\n<maxb> Hmm, we need to define an actual policy for when to promote things to the stable ppa\n<maxb> but for now, I think I shall just go ahead and promote bzr 2.2.2 since I've just noticed we haven't ye\n<maxb> t\n<poolie> wfm\n<spiv> poolie: heh\n<spiv> poolie: o/\n<maxb> poolie: You did review=approve on my hydrazine mp - I take it you also mean merge=approve?\n<poolie> yes\n<spiv> Hooray, tests passing again.

(Or is it a case where logs are lost when used with some web server app framework..)\n<Glenjamin> in this case i'm proxying through to serve-branches\n<vila> I think you want to retry later with mkanat (he doesn't appear to be online right now)\n<Glenjamin> there appears to be a stable 1.18, any idea if there's a PPA?\n<vila> hmm, they may be several even... let me check\n<vila> Glenjamin: running lucid or maverick ?\n<Glenjamin> lucid\n<vila> stable bzr ppa carries only 1.17\n<vila> same for proposed :-/\n<vila> and beta\n<vila> Glenjamin: and the loggerhead project on lp mentions only the source tarball, that's all I know about it, sorry\n<Glenjamin> no probs, thanks for looking at it\n<vila> Tiriel: what structure are you referring too ? bzr internals ? history of a given branch ? relationships between branches ?\n<Glenjamin> I could get it to work by proxying smart server requests to bazaar on wsgi instead of loggerhead, but its not that important on that server - was just going to try and get simple http reading for when we dont have ssh\n<Tiriel> relationships between branches, and maybe branch history as well\n<vila> Tiriel: try 'bzr qlog branch1' and 'bzr qlog branch1 branch2 ... branchn' from the qbzr plugin\n<Glenjamin> the branch-ancestry command does something like that from bzrtools iirc\n<Glenjamin> branch-history\n<Tiriel> Yeah, well, I was lookin for something more like UML modeling for version control systems\n<Tiriel> I don't have a deployed system at the moment\n<Glenjamin> there's graph-ancestry - that outputs something in dot\n<pfarrell> hi, I have a quick question: when I check out an svn repository with bzr-svn, it starts building a cache in ~/.cache/bazaar/svn. I don't want it to put it in $HOME, as that's on the network and really slow. Can I tell bzr-svn to put it somewhere else?\n<jelmer> pfarrell: you should be able to make that directory a symlink to somewhere else\n<pfarrell> true, yep\n<pfarrell> thanks for the suggestion\n<alf_> Hi, I am trying to merge a branch containing only one revision and then throw away the changes and replace them with my own. However, when I bzr revert after \"bzr merge . -r:tag\" the merge is forgotten too.\n<alf_> I thought I had to use \"--forget-merges\" to make bzr bzr forget the pending merge.\n<alf_> is this the expected behaviour?\n<maxb> alf_: The way it works is as follows:\n<maxb> 'bzr revert' reverts tree content and pending merge tips\n<maxb> 'bzr revert <paths>' reverts the tree content specified\n<maxb> 'bzr revert --forget-merges' reverts only pending merge tips\n<alf_> maxb: yes, that makes sense, thanks!\n<vila> maxb: regarding ppa promotion, I was waiting for bzr-explorer-1.1.2 before using lp-promote-ppa for the first time ! (You broke my toy :-)\n<vila> maxb: not a problem anyway, it's good to have 2.2.2 deployed\n<UnhappyVssUser> Hello! We use VSS here with more or less success. Well, now our team gets bigger and the VSS data-file errors more. I want to go to a DVCS. Well, I checked their features and ma happy with them. But!!!! No shared files?? can it be possible? We have all over the place shared files. I think that because I read it in the VSS2Git documentation. So I hope Bazaar can do that.\n<piranha> hi all. Is there any examples of how can I do a merge programmatically from Python? I found bzrlib.merge.merge_inner(), but it does seem to only add changes and not revisions.

It looks like you'll need to ask a launchpad admin for help.\n<servilio> hi all! I am trying to install setuptools_bzr in a Python 2.4 environment, but it fails with \"AttributeError: 'KnitPackRepository' object has no attribute 'get_revision_inventory'\"\n<servilio> already tried with bzr 2.2 and 2.3b4\n<servilio> any ideas why this is happening?\n<Peng> servilio: Repository.get_revision_inventory() was deprecated and then removed in 2.2.\n<Peng> servilio: FWIW you should use Repository.get_inventory() AFAIK, though this doesn't help you too much if the problem is in setuptools_bzr.\n<servilio> Peng: thanks! I suspected something like was happening, but I haven't kept track of the bzr internals\n<servilio> I tried to install bzr 2.1, but there is no downloadable tarball in pypi looks like\n<peitschie> mornin everybody :)\n<thumper> morning\n<jelmer_> 'morning peitschie, thumper\n<thumper> jelmer_: hey\n<thumper> jelmer_: I'd love some comment on my email to the bzr list :)\n<peitschie> mornin jelmer_\n<peitschie> mornin thumper :)\n<poolie> hi all\n<peitschie> mornin poolie\n<spiv> Morning poolie, peitschie.\n<spiv> (plus plenty other people...)\n<poolie> hi there\n<peitschie> hiya spiv\n#bzr 2010-12-03\n<achiang> hello, can someone explain what i'm doing wrong here? http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/539211/\n<achiang> trying to make it so that my streamflow project uses my personal email, not my work email\n<achiang> according to the help i found on google, that syntax i used should work...\n<mwhudson> achiang: what file is that top section from?\n<mwhudson> i think it needs to be ~/.bazaar/locations.conf, not ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf\n<achiang> mwhudson: ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf\n<achiang> mwhudson: hm, interesting\n<achiang> i will try again\n<achiang> mwhudson: yes, that was it, thank you\n<mwhudson> achiang: np\n<achiang> mwhudson: the problem was entirely mine. i read this page too fast -- http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/ConfiguringBzr\n<poolie> hi mwh, achiang\n<achiang> the documentation clearly says locations.conf, and i misread it\n<achiang> so your documentation is good, i am just dumb. :)\n<achiang> poolie: hi\n<maxb> $ bzr resolve --take-this .bzrignore\n<maxb> 0 conflict(s) resolved, 1 remaining\n<maxb> erm, what?\n<maxb> (yes, .bzrignore is conflicted)\n<maxb> text conflicted, that is\n<spiv> maxb: :(\n<lifeless> maxb: bzr resolve --take-this .bzrignore.THIS ?\n<poolie> maxb, iirc what vila said, it does not mark it as resolved\n<poolie> it should\n<poolie> we should distinguish \"do this to the file\" from \"mark the conflict as solved\"\n<thumper> hey\n<thumper> how do I set append only for an existing branch on LP?\n<spiv> thumper: by editing the branch.conf file, I think :(\n<thumper> what?\n<thumper> that's a bit primitive\n<spiv> thumper: I expect vila's config work will provide UI for this fairly soon\n<thumper> spiv: what do I need to add?\n<thumper> I'm sure hitchhiker can work wonders\n<spiv> append_revisions_only = True\n<spiv> Or open the branch object and call br.set_append_revisions_only(True)\n<poolie> thumper: thanks for your mail about apis, i'm replying\n<poolie> spiv, maybe we should pair together more\n<poolie> i was thinking of buying a desktop rather than headset mike\n<mkanat> poolie: Any hope of getting my loggerhead changes pushed to LP?\n<mkanat> Or approved, at least.\n<poolie> good question!\n<poolie> did i review but not mark them approved?\n<poolie> or... there are probably more still unreviewed?\n<mkanat> poolie: Ah, I merged them into loggerhead, but the LP branch push MP is still waiting a review.\n<glyph> Hey, I have a workflow hiccup with bzr that I am wondering if you guys can shed some light on.\n<glyph> I frequently encounter diverged branches that I don't really expect\n<glyph> this is mainly in my 'personal preferences' repository, which I keep on several machines\n<glyph> the sort of pattern is this; I'm on a plane, I make some settings adjustment based on some new tidbit of information (like, a shell helper that I didn't realize was doing a DNS lookup or something like that, that I discover because I'm offline)\n<glyph> commit locally\n<thumper> poolie: cool\n<glyph> then later I make changes to the repository on my desktop, push those changes\n<glyph> and then, 30 seconds before I go somewhere, I do a quick 'bzr pull' on my laptop\n<glyph> oops!  branches diverged.  but my upstream is kind of crappy, so it takes 45 seconds to actually do the SSH handshake with my server, and I'm leaving for a meeting or something, so I just leave without my changes.\n<mkanat> glyph: Ah, you have to do a \"bzr merge\" in that situation instead.\n<glyph> mkanat: Oh, I know *that*.  But 'bzr merge' needs to do the SSH handshake again and deal with RTT again and it's slow.\n<glyph> More importantly, I have to do something interactive\n<maxb> glyph: Perhaps you would be interested in 'bzr merge --pull' (pull if you can, otherwise merge)\n<glyph> maxb: Hmm, maybe that is what I want\n<glyph> although\n<maxb> Of course, you still need to commit and push\n<glyph> what I _really_ want is 'pull if you can, otherwise, put the diverged branch in some helpful location in the same repository, so you can merge from it later'\n<maxb> Well, it's not the greatest of UIs, but that kind of already happens (except for the helpful bit)\n<glyph> haha\n<glyph> maxb: is that bzr's motto?\n<glyph> maxb: 'that already works, except for the helpful bit'\n<maxb> The not-actually-pulled head will be stored in the local repository and visible in 'bzr heads --dead'\n<maxb> you would be able to merge it by revision-id later\n<glyph> woah\n<glyph> that's pretty awesome\n<glyph> so the network I/O actually _does_ happen?\n<maxb> sure, it's not just pretending :-)\n<glyph> well, I knew _some_ did\n<glyph> I didn't realize it actually pulled all of the revs though\n<glyph> so, how about this\n<glyph> if I make a no-tree branch in my branch and then only ever pull into it\n<glyph> then I can just do 'cd upstream; bzr pull'\n<glyph> and then 'cd ..; bzr merge --pull upstream'\n<glyph> when I have a moment to sit and merge later, but potentially no network I/O\n<glyph> hmm, if I do 'bzr get . upstream', it works, but it doesn't appear to use the working directory as a shared repository\n<glyph> the branch in question is ~/something, and I don't want ~ to be a shared repository.  'bzr init-repository .' complains that '.bzr' already exists.\n<glyph> do I have any option here?\n<maxb> erm, possibly\n<maxb> let me test something....\n<maxb> It's rather cheating quite a lot, but it seems as if 'touch .bzr/repository/shared-storage' convinces bzr to use an existing branch's repository as a shared repository for contained branches\n<glyph> maxb: hmm\n<glyph> maxb: maybe I don't need to do that\n<glyph> now that I'm looking at the output of heads --dead, I can see that it's basically doing what I want\n<glyph> yeah\n<glyph> okay this is cool\n<glyph> maxb: thanks for the info\n<spiv> poolie: it would be interesting to try pairing more\n<spiv> poolie: I'd have to have a bit of a think about headsets etc.\n<poolie> perhaps we should just meet up and actually pair?\n<poolie> i feel a bit buried with stuff i've already started but really there's no reason we couldn't pair on that\n<poolie> or or things you have in train\n<glyph> so, now I think I know how to phrase my request\n<glyph> spiv: there should be a 'bzr merge --last' (or perhaps just the default behavior of 'bzr merge' if there are pulled-but-not-merged revisions)\n<glyph> if 'bzr pull' fails\n<glyph> or \"if the branches have diverged\"\n<glyph> it looks like 'push' actually fixes the divergent revisions too?  this is really neat!\n<glyph> push actually _pulls_ the divergent revisions\n<spiv> glyph: how precisely would you define \"last\"?\n<maxb> merge --last is an interesting concept. It's roughly equivalent to .git/FETCH_HEAD\n<spiv> glyph: you mean the head most recently added to the repo?\n<glyph> spiv: I *think* that's what I mean, but I don't understand those terms perfectly, so, to be explicit:\n<glyph> bzr pull; oops, diverged; bzr merge # don't do any network I/O, you already have a diverged merge tip, just merge it\n<glyph> I don't really know about .git/FETCH_HEAD, because one of the best things - perhaps _the_ best thing about bzr, is the fact that it prevents me from needing to learn anything at all about git :)\n<spiv> glyph: so the trick is finding the right diverged tip\n<spiv> glyph: maybe you have other tips from doing \"bzr merge; bzr revert\", or from \"bzr uncommit\".\n<glyph> spiv: well, this is why I phrased my requirement that way.\n<glyph> spiv: You could have 'bzr pull' specifically remember which tip is the right one, when the branches have diverged, and have other things wipe that memory\n<glyph> spiv: 'bzr pull; bzr whatever; bzr merge --last' would just say 'Sorry, last command wasn't a pull, I don't know what tip you mean.\"\n<dmuir> kind of a noob question, but how do I go about manually creating patch files? I've got a situation where I've got two trees with no common base, and I just want to copy over some revisions.\n<dmuir> is it simply `bzr diff -c revno > filename.patch` ?\n<dmuir> and and then `bzr merge filename.patch`?\n<dmuir> hmm, that didn't work\n<peitschie> dmuir: I think you need to use the gnu \"patch\" command to apply the batch\n<peitschie> it won't handle renames or binary files correctly however\n<dmuir> hmm, ok\n<peitschie> dmuir: give this a try? http://www.cuberick.com/2009/02/merge-bazaar-repositories-with-no.html\n<glyph> dmuir: 'bzr send'\n<glyph> peitschie: woah, that is rad.\n<dmuir> hmm, if I understand the cuberick trick, I'm basically cherrypicking the tree as a whole?\n<dmuir> I'm still getting a bunch of conflicts, but I think they're all fairly straight forward.\n<peitschie> dmuir: sounds about right\n<peitschie> glyph: I think send wants to provide a bundle, which pretty much requires a common ancestor?\n<dmuir> hmm, send crashed on me\n<dmuir> bzrtools's patch seems to do the job reasonably well\n<spiv> glyph: ok, I'd call that option --last-pull in that case.\n<glyph> spiv: really, I just want it to be the default behavior of 'merge' :)\n<spiv> glyph: have a local mirror of the source branch, and have that mirror associated as the parent branch, and you'd have that ;)\n<glyph> spiv: any better way to do the branch-and-shared-repository thing?\n<glyph> it would just be handy to have the local mirror be an empty dir called 'upstream' ;)\n<UnhappyVssUser> In VSS (M****** Source Safe) there are shared files. A file is always in a vss \"project\" (a directory). If you share it (VSS terminology), the same file can appear in multiple projects. Let's say I have a configuration file \"OurCommonConfigs.xml\". We have this file in all our Visual Studio projects. But we don't want to manually(!) update it in all places where it is used. When I edit it in project X it should be updated in project Y \n<UnhappyVssUser> possible with GIT?\n<poolie> this isn't the git channel\n<UnhappyVssUser> Err, I mean Bazaar. You see I'm evaluating the various Source control\n<poolie> you could store it in a bzr branch and reference it from all your projects\n<UnhappyVssUser> systems.\n<poolie> by a lnk, or some other means\n<poolie> bzr won't automatically update every checkout of it\n<spiv> glyph: you can do e.g. \"bzr init-repo foo --no-trees; cd foo; bzr init .; bzr pull $my_branch; bzr branch $upstream upstream\"\n<spiv> glyph: although it might be nicer and simpler to use the bzr-colo plugin\n<UnhappyVssUser> Thanks, I'll look up branch and link benhaviour\n<vila> hi all\n<vila> pingeling about https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~vila/bzr/638451-malformed/+merge/41759\n<poolie> hi there vila\n<vila> poolie: hey !\n<poolie> sorry vila, i really wanted to do that today\n<poolie> didn't get to it\n<poolie> :/\n<vila> Should I just land this mp, I summarized in the cover letter that I addressed the points raised, but I'm always a bit hesitant to do that sort of thing\n * poolie looks quickly\n<poolie> i have to go soon\n<vila> poolie: yeah, no worries, I've seen a couple of interesting mails from you :)\n<poolie> does it actually resolve things?\n<poolie> i mean, does it mark the conflict resolved?\n<vila> oh yes\n<poolie> it looks basically ok\n<poolie> so, weak +1 if you're confident to merge it\n<poolie> now i have to go; have a good day!\n<poolie> and weekend\n<vila> poolie: you too ! and thanks !\n<vila> too slow ;)\n<UnhappyVssUser> Regarding shared VSS files: I have read about the \"branch\" command but didn't found the \"lnk\" command in documentation. The branch command creates a new repository! Not really what shared files are. But let's assume I make a branch for this file and put it in a shared repository. When I change the file, I change it in this branch. Then there is another branch (smae repository) which contains the class-files of the program. Is it possi\n<UnhappyVssUser> class files and the \"Shared\" file in the same physical directory the developer uses to work with (say: \"C:\\Product\\CurrentDev\\ProjectA\\class1.cs\" and \"C:\\Product\\CurrentDev\\ProjectA\\Options.xml\")? Do you think the Visual Studio plugin will be able to handle this situation?\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: I think poolie meant 'lnk' as in a link to a file that is not part of the branch you're working in but pointing to a file managed in its own branch\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: the point is that bzr handles trees not individual files when it comes to versioning, and I suspect you don't want this file to be part of every revision in all your project branches\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: because if you revert to a previous revision you don't want to revert this file too\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: or not ?\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: by the way, your previous msgs were truncated making them a bit unclear\n<UnhappyVssUser> vila: Sorry for the truncated texts. Opera browser makes that (if you meant the two lines).\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: the first one ends with 'It is poss' and the second starts with 'class files and'\n<UnhappyVssUser> It seems I havn't understood the philosophy of bazaar full. Let me explain: VSS is very simple (I hear you laughing, don't!). In a project(directory) you check out your file, edit it and check it in. If you want a version, you \"label\" it, say \"v2.3.44\". If you want that version you \"get\" a \"label\". too be continued...\n<vila> I'm not laughing, I feel your pain :)\n<UnhappyVssUser> A \"shared file\" exists in x directories. If you \"label\" the directory/project and later \"get\" that \"label\" the you get also the \"shared file\"\n<vila> right, so that's a fundamental difference\n<vila> with bzr you don't version files, you version trees\n<UnhappyVssUser> Well, but what do you do if you want to have the same file on multiple places?\n<UnhappyVssUser> Don't tell me you edit all of them manually!!!\n<vila> the question is whether you want this file to follow the history of its containing tree or not\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: if you revert a tree to a previous revision, do *you* want this file to also revert to this previous revision ?\n<UnhappyVssUser> yes, it should also revert to the previous revision (\"label\")\n<UnhappyVssUser> I'm looking up the \"tree\" and what it represents in VSS....if there is such a thing\n<vila> ok, in this case, you're after nested trees, which are not fully implemented (yet) in bzr, but even there, the plan is to nest *trees* not files, so you'll have to put this file in its own directory (AFAIUI)\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: I suspect a tree is really a label: i.e. the set of (file, revision) that happen to carry this label\n<vila> .. but may be not, (how would updates of the shared files propagate to other labels ?)\n<UnhappyVssUser> I found it in bazaar doc: http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/migration/en/survival/bzr-for-vss-users.html\n<UnhappyVssUser> A \"label\" seems to be a tag\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: right, this page says that Share is N/A\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: surely the person that wrote it knows VSS (I don't, I *guess* it's closer to CVS than to bzr)\n<fullermd> Well, if you're going to insult CVS...\n<vila> fullermd: hey !\n<vila> I rarely insult tools anymore these days, they tend to just ignore me when I do that\n<fullermd> They ignore me too, but it's still very cathartic to scream at them.\n<vila> ... another reason is that ISTM, these insults tend to bounce back at me for trusting the tools too much :-D\n<UnhappyVssUser> Ok bazaarians, I'm a friendly person too and this Linus guy makes insults even in pulbic speeches. So I'm not very GIT-friendly. I would prefer Bazaar. When can I expect nested trees? It seems I'm the only guy who has the same file at multiple places. It was not my idea, it's Visual Studio.\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: not soon enough :-/ But there are plugins which tries to address the same kind of compositing, bzr-externals and... bialix will hate me for forgetting the other...\n<vila> someone help me ?\n<vila> scmproj !\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: both externals and scmproj are actively maintained and part of the devs (if not all) are on windows too, so they should be able to help you better than me\n<UnhappyVssUser> vila: Thanks for the link. More to read...\n<UnhappyVssUser> vila: I thank you very much. Very helpful. I'll check the plugins...\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: you're welcome\n<UnhappyVssUser> have a good day (The boss appeared at my office ...uh)\n<UnhappyVssUser> He does not know of his bazaar luck, yet\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: quick ! Bring up your facebook page ! Enough of this productivity-enhancing tools discussions !!\n<UnhappyVssUser> lol\n<vila> :)\n<UnhappyVssUser> But honestly, this is his thinking\n<UnhappyVssUser> unfortunately, we must \"introduce\" changes secretly until they work and present after they are a success. Before: \"costs too much\", \"no effort in this direction\"\n<vila> fullermd: by the way, just curious, how would you address this 'shared file' issue in CVS ?\n<vila> UnhappyVssUser: Yeah, I know the feeling :-/\n<vila> fullermd: CVSROOT/modules tinkering ?\n<fullermd> I s'pose you could \"ln -s /some/other/repo/foo,v .\"\n<vila> fullermd: naaah, on windows man, no funny symlinks...\n<fullermd> Well, you wouldn't be hosting a CVS repo on windows in the first place...\n<vila> fullermd: pff, cheater :D\n<fullermd> Man, if we're running CVS, cheating is de rigeur   :p\n<vila> LOL\n<vila> good to know I can use 'de rigueur' with English people ;)\n<fullermd> Oh, did French borrow that phrase from English too?   ;>\n<vila> something like that certainly ;D\n<vila> ha ! window is easy, just one click is enough !\n<vila> The trouble is to find which one...\n<vila> mgz, jam: For the record, export BZR_SSH=openssh now works for the babune slave *including* using the ssh keys forwarded from the babune master, \\o/\n<mgz> for the further record, what exactly did you need to change vila?\n<vila> hmm\n<vila> the ssh server service should be started by the babune user\n<vila> starting a service should be allowed from a user with an empty password\n<vila> lp key should be registered in the right known_hosts file\n<vila> of course none of those admin tweaks could be recorded in a bzr branch :-(\n<mgz> but it's what we have irc logs for :)\n<vila> one more test including booting the slave\n<vila> hehe\n<vila> mgz: http://babune.ladeuil.net:24842/job/selftest-subset-windows/23/console\n<mgz> it's blue!\n<vila> mgz: also note that bzr has stopped complaining about lp-id\n<vila> *subset* !\n<vila> this address the msgeditor failure\n<mgz> yes, but that subset would have been red.\n<vila> yup\n<vila> but that gave me 1) a simple subset to play with 2) a strong incentive to address the annoying-for-far-too-long issues :D\n<mgz> the remaining issues just need the same thing.\n<vila> mgz: note that this morning I was about to re-install windows from scratch before a let-s-try-one-more-thing urge :)\n<mgz> well, one's a real tough bug, but I'll find the time to finish squishing that.\n<vila> the trick was to find the real error behind: 'can't start the service for this user' and from there find where to click to allow a service to be launched by a user with an empty password...\n<vila> mgz: by the way, I tried plink too and I was close to make it work there too, but I resign once I understood that pageant can only be a starting point when it comes to forwarding ssh keys...\n<vila> which I reckon is because nobody can run a ssh server properly on windows\n<vila> The setup I ended up with, really only works for the the babune user, any other one will encounter the same kind of issue\n<vila> which basically are: sshd -> bzr -> ssh\n<vila> the ssh processes can't communicate reliably because bzr being a native app broke some cygwin assumption about who owns what including one socket/file required to communicate between the two ssh processes\n<vila> mgz: re-running a full test suite to see where we are now\n<mgz> that all sounds about right\n<mgz> I don't even get checkboxes, needed to use ntrights for some perms stuff for my test setup.\n<mgz> and manually setting HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\limitblankpassworduse\n<vila> don't mention guessing how this has been translated in French...\n<vila> I've already forgot :D\n<vila> and  this was less than an hour ago :D\n<mgz> well, I'd forgotten the details too, had to go off and find the script where I'd documented what I'd done when you jogged my memory about blank password problems.\n<vila> too bad I didn't know about the ability to do this kind of stuff via scripts, I would have been more prone to record my tweaks this way :-/\n<mgz> well, that particular script is 50% docstring and 50% after-the-fact test :)\n<vila> yup, I love doc strings for this kind of stiff\n<vila> stuff\n<vila> oops\n<mgz> \"do these steps, then running this should start working\"\n<vila> yeah, better than mere: do this stuff again next time if you're lucky enough to remember\n<vila> which, as mentioned above, I'm not very good at ;D\n<vila> mgz: I had some hope for some vbox fix in the recently release 3.0.12, but the 'lost connection during test' errors are still there :-/\n<vila> 3.2.12 even\n<mgz> we will need more informaton on that to work out what exactly is going on.\n<vila> I painfully know :D\n<vila> mgz: wow, have you ever noticed the 'Age' column in the babune failed tests ?\n<mgz> yup, that's why I bugged you about the one you just fixed, because it was new-but-not-random\n<vila> excellent...\n<vila> mgz: surprising new failures in the launchpad plugin\n<mgz> those do look odd.\n<vila> mgz: surprising + 3 failures *and* surprising +3 tests... very weird\n<mgz> possibly related to your lp login change?\n<vila> failed in run #253 but not in #252 with only unrelated changes bewteen the 2 ?\n<mgz> sorry, as in:\n<mgz> <vila> lp key should be registered in the right known_hosts file\n<mgz> <vila> mgz: also note that bzr has stopped complaining about lp-id\n<vila> ooooh\n<mgz> I'd hope the test would be sufficiently isolated, but it may well not me.\n<mgz> *be\n<vila> bad test isolation then\n<vila> :)\n<mgz> def get_lp_login(_config=None):\n<mgz>     if _config is None:\n<mgz>         _config = GlobalConfig()\n<mgz>     username =

isn't\n<mgz> I thought you told Gordon it was for his mergetools mp...\n<vila> no, I mean, TestCaseInTempDir should, but it seems the test manage to escape it\n<vila> unless....\n<mgz> ah. well, it's a bug to fix, I can't repo it here unfortunately.\n<vila> os.environ.get('BZR_HOME') returns None ???\n<vila> urgh: tests.TestCase.setUp(self)\n<mgz> ha!\n<mgz> I'd not noticed that.\n<mgz> one line fix to get you three passing tests again.\n<vila> sry, that was obscure, it's in a test class based on TestCaseInTempDir\n<vila> how creative we can be to defeat our own checks...\n<mgz> yeah, I saw it when you pasted.\n<mgz> it looks deliberate, so better just check the mp from barry, but seems like it should just be changed.\n<vila> and that fixes them all (of course)\n<vila> oooh, I can of recall this mp, I may even be the one that proposed the \"fix\" :D\n<mgz> karma!\n<vila> s/can/kind/\n<vila> hihi\n<vila> I don't quite get how it was passing before though...\n<vila> raising

I hardly know 'er!\n<vila> but I won't use accented letters in a branch name, oh no, I've better things to do ;-p\n<mgz> fugitive_launchpad_plugin_tests\n<fullermd> Ah yes, Bon Jovi telling us how to write tests   :p\n<mgz> I thought they were written by the man with one arm.\n<vila> they put several arms in servers these days\n<vila> fugitif can also means stealth in french\n<mgz> right, it's slightly emphasising the sneaking around trying to avoid recapture rather than the gaol break itself.\n<fullermd> I'm pretty sure it comes from Latin, so...\n<vila> Tempos fugit ?\n<fullermd> Same root.\n<vila> indeed\n<vila> time feels longer in jail, because you're closer to its roots\n<vila> https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~vila/bzr/684662-fugitive-launchpad-plugin-tests/+merge/42605\n<vila> mgz: meh, for bzrlib.tests.blackbox.test_version.TestVersionUnicodeOutput.test_unicode_bzr_home  we use get_user_encoding() for a path (BZR_HOME) ??\n<vila> mgz: is that the right thing to do or a buggy test ?\n<mgz> yeah, and the test is a little bogus anyway which is why I've not bothered squishing it yet.\n<mgz> as is the actual implementation, anything using 'safe_unicode' is asking for things to blow up randomly.\n<vila> in config.py you mean ?\n<vila> I wonder if I added this to make this test pass... in anger\n<mgz> it was failing for me (in a different way) before that, I think related to depending on the cwd or environment\n * vila tries a full run without this safe_unicode call\n<vila> yeah, indeed, this test fails at a totally different place\n<vila> and what's the rule about env vars encoding ? It was discussed before no ?\n<mgz> they're in user encoding.\n<mgz> can't get at unicode environment with python 2 unfortunately.\n<vila> ha ! That was it\n<vila> right,single test failing\n<vila> so the safe_unicode may be necessary but at a different place\n<mgz> no. bad vila.\n<vila> but then the test itself is valid\n<vila> rhaaa, I meant user_decoding the env var :D\n<mgz> is never nessersary, it's just sticking a plaster on it.\n<mgz> yup.\n<vila> but waitaminute, wan't the discussion saying something different between windows and the others there ?\n<vila> (about env var encoding)\n<vila> s/wan't/wasn't/\n<mgz> well, for nix you can shove any old junk in the environment block\n<mgz> if you do that on windows, you're liable to crash your process\n<vila> so the decoding should happen on windows only ?\n<mgz> well, depends on the abstraction, but on nix we need at least to cope with the idea that the bytes may not be in the user's encoding\n<vila> hmm, the problem seems so vague it's hard to address it :-/\n<mgz> python 3 basically swaps having a problem on windows (with not being able to access the unicode environment) for a problem on nix (not being able to use arbitrary bytes)\n<mgz> which they now 'solve' with a combination of two apis for everything, and the god-awful 'surrogate escape' codec\n<mgz> also known as, the 'please break my xml' codec\n<vila> you're just adding weight to my remark :)\n<mgz> clear abstrations help but yeah, some of this stuff is just complex\n<mgz> +c\n<vila> basically we should start with s/os.environ.get/osutils.get_env/ or something\n<vila> I'm sure this will raise some eyebrows...\n<vila> 53 matches...\n<vila> wrong, 160 matches, there are os.environ[xx] uses\n<mgz> or just limit the apis that access the environment, and make them locale-sane depending on what we're trying to get out (a path, a flag, etc)\n<vila> yeah, second step :-/\n<mgz> we've still got quite a lot of fiddly little bits of platform-specific code scattered around despite the osutils module\n<vila> but I would rather not add this if we don't need to, flag and especially 'etc' shouldn't suffer\n<vila> yeah :-/\n<vila> I know :(\n<vila> right, bug #262874\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 262874 in Bazaar \"enviroment may not be in get_user_encoding() on Windows\" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/262874\n<vila> mgz: so that's not quite user encoding even :-/\n * vila lunch\n<mgz> that's a semantics-and-implementation thing\n<mgz> have meant to close that bug out for a while.\n<vila> I'll defer to you then ?\n<mgz> basically, don't worry about that, and assume it's always in the user encoding.\n<vila> err, but isn't the \"don't worry\" attitude that led us there ? :D\n<mgz> not in that case :)\n<vila> I'll look into bzrlib.tests.test_transform.TestTreeTransform.test_rename_fails  instead (after lunch ;)\n<mgz> what get_user_encoding does is poorly defined, and on windows we'd be better off with a raw GetACP, but that's basically what it does\n<mgz> which is also what the mbcs codec uses, so will in the decoding case where all bytes are in the codepage (and it doesn't have to replace invalid ones) do the same thing\n<mgz> bt.test_transform.TestTreeTransform.test_rename_fails is one I've got fixed vila, though you may want to add your skip_if_root thing to the top as it relies on a permissions failure\n<vila> mgz: meh, fixed where ?\n<vila> mgz: I thought the problem was to match on the error string instead of the error code those failing on the slave localized in french, but I haven't really dug so far\n<ScottK> Is there a way to checkout/branch just part of a bzr repo?  I just need http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-bugcontrol/qa-regression-testing/master/files/head:/scripts/ and the rest of that repository is frickin' huge.\n<vila> ScottK: no, you can't (yet)\n<ScottK> Sigh.\n<ScottK> Can the duration of yet be quantified at all?\n<vila> hardly\n<vila> or rather, it would be shorter to checkout the whole :-}\n<ScottK> Right.  Just wanted to know if I should ask again next week or in 2020.\n<ScottK> (this isn't the first time I've missed this feature)\n<vila> ScottK: there are several sub parts to address: one being to transfer no more than the last revision. Otherwise getting a subtree once you have part or all of the history is something that 'views' is supposed to address\n<vila> ScottK: but I've never played with 'views' myself\n * ScottK nods\n<vila> transferring only the last revision may be worked on, I'm not sure, but it's often asked for UDD so it may happen sooner than I think\n<jam> vila: so the debuntu stuff was why Windows was failing from the TEMP paths?\n<vila> jam: oh ! hi !\n<vila> hmm, no, the debuntu stuff revealed itself once I fixed the babune windows slave config\n<vila> jam: damn, my history is too short, waitasec\n<vila> <vila> mgz, jam: For the record, export BZR_SSH=openssh now works for the babune slave *including* using the ssh keys forwarded from the babune master, \\o/\n<vila> <mgz> for the further record, what exactly did you need to change vila?\n<vila> <vila> hmm\n<vila> <vila> the ssh server service should be started by the babune user\n<vila> <vila> starting a service should be allowed from a user with an empty password\n<vila> <vila> lp key should be registered in the right known_hosts file\n<vila> <vila> of course none of those admin tweaks could be recorded in a bzr branch :-(\n<vila> jam: so, from there, the windows slave suddenly got a launchpad login which triggered the test isolation bug\n<jam> vila: why does it need an lp login?\n<mkanat> Is there anything to guess the mime type of a file in the repository, in bzrlib?\n<vila> jam: to get rid of some annoying warnings and use the smart server instead of http\n<jam> mkanat: I don't believe there is mime awareness inside bzrlib\n<mkanat> jam: Okay.\n<jam> vila: is that for the test suite itself? or for other stuff\n<mkanat> All I really would want was something that would check the first few bytes of a file in the repo and guess its mime type.\n<jam> I'm fine w/ other stuff, but I'd like to understand what the *test suite* is trying to do\n<jam> mkanat: to get the first few bytes basically gets all of them\n<jam> so you may as well get the text and send it to \"file\"\n<mkanat> jam: Fair enough. I'm trying to avoid that, though.\n<mkanat> jam: This is for loggerhead, and I want to return a generator that can stream the file, but I also want to have reliably mime-type guessing. I'm going to be doing it based on the file name, but still.\n<jam> mkanat: do what you feel is best, just letting you know that we don't extract partial content\n<mkanat> jam: Okay.\n<jam> extracting content is probably a O(2x size-of-fulltext deal)\n<jam> one for the delta buffer, one for the final text\n<mkanat> Sure, I just don't want it in memory if I can avoid it, as much as possible.\n<jam> (and 0.5 for the compressed content of the delta buffer)\n<jam> mkanat: 'as much as possible' would probably mean extracting it, writing it to a temp file, streaming from that\n<mkanat> jam: Well, I was just going to return an iter_bytes or whatever it's called.\n<jam> mkanat: that just extracts the whole thing, and probably caches all the intermediate stuff until its done\n<vila> jam: both, it makes the pulls faster and it gives access from the slave to the master for planned features\n<mkanat> jam: Okay. But will that always be the case? I mean, if bzr improves, I'll get the improvement there too.\n<jam> mkanat: I would not expect us to change that for a long time\n<vila> jam: including: automated updates for dependencies, upload of artifacts from slave to master, etc\n<mkanat> jam: Okay, well, what about the big-file work?\n<jam> mkanat: there is one proposal which might break up big content into smaller chunks, but that is goingto complicate whatever you try to do anyway\n<jam> vila: all not test-suite related, afaict. I think it is great that you have it. My concern is why it affected the *test suite*\n<mkanat> jam: But if it's just an iter, it shouldn't complicate anything.\n<vila> jam: the test suite doesn't require ssh access, but the slave get its branches from lp (so far). If you look at some old windows runs, you'll notice the lp-related warning\n<mkanat> jam: I suppose the problem is that you have to build the revision text before you can stream it?\n<jam> mkanat: well iter_bytes *today* is just [content_string]\n<jam> it might change in the future, but that is pretty unlikely at this point\n<jam> vila: sure. Though you said \"I fixed the login stuff, and suddenly the test started failing\"\n<vila> jam: yes, that's what happened\n<jam> vila: hence my concern why external config is affecting the test suite\n<vila> jam: you didn't read the fix don't you ?\n<vila> jam: the test was getting a launchpad login by accessing the local bazaar.conf in $HOME instead of the empty one we create under TMP\n<jam> vila: ah, ok. So the fix should actually remove the dependency. I did read the fix\n<vila> which dependency ?\n<jam> vila: the existing code accidentally dependend on the users config because it escaped isolation. You noticed the bug because of changing the user config, which prompted you to fix the dependency. Future test runs should be properly isolated from user config. \\o/\n<vila> but they are as long as they use TestCaseInTempDir and not TestCase\n<vila> these ones are a bit special as in this case they were unexpected successes but I felt it wasn't worth the time to guard against that\n<vila> I think I mentioned in the cover letter that they were probably succeeding before because InvalidURL was being raised earlier (while attempting to connect without a proper lp login or something)\n<mkanat> Is there a way to get the size of the content that iter_file_bytes is going to return, or do I just have to get all the bytes and then do len(content)?\n<jam> mkanat: tree.inventory[file_id].text_size\n<mkanat> jam: Awesome, thank you. :-)\n<hazmat> when using bzr-pipeline, and switching pipes is there a way a hook can be invoked, i often have *.pyc files that end up cluttering directories that are added and removed, which generates spurious conflicts when navigating up/down the pipe\n<mkanat> mwhudson: Do you know what the motivation was behind choosing SimpleTAL for loggerhead?\n<mgz> vila: that test will start passing when bug 273978 is fixed, which I have a branch for (unproposed as yet, still needs work)\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 273978 in Bazaar \"UnicodeDecodeError when strerror is not ascii\" [Low,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/273978\n<vila> mgz: haaa, good :) Oh yeah, I remember now !\n<vila> EOD here (and invited by friends so I'll may poke here far later but that's rather unsure ;)\n<mgz> it's one of my top things to do before 2.3 now I've sorted the testing unicode stuff, just need a space to bash it in.\n<mgz> food for me too.\n<mkanat> Wow, bzr really *is* fast, when you use the API right. It's pretty remarkable sometimes.\n<mkanat> I'm doing everything needed to get a file out of the system and send it to the client in 0.05 seconds or less.\n<jam> mkanat: simpletal was the fastest reasonable engine at the time, and was used elsewhere, IIRC\n<mkanat> jam: Ah, okay.\n<mkanat> Is that what Launchpad is using also, or is it using something else?\n<jam> I think there was a push at one point to use something like Cheetah, which compiles the same syntax into python bytecode\n<mkanat> jam: Yeah, I was thinking Mako actually.\n<jam> mkanat: IIRC, simpletal is zope's engine pulled out\n<jam> and LP is built on zope\n<mkanat> jam: Ahh, okay.\n<mkanat> So there's also shared expertise.\n<jam> right, though using the same syntax with a faster engine would be fine\n<mkanat> It's fine, I don't have any problems with SimpleTAL right now. I mean, no major problems. The templates would be cleaner in Mako.\n<jam> I think we wanted to avoid a different TAL\n<jam> (template language, if that is actually a bad acronym)\n<mkanat> Yeah.\n<beuno> mkanat, jam, we went with simpletal because it was fast, and used TAL, which is what Launchpad used, so we where familiar with it\n<mkanat> Okay. I think TAL has some nice advantages, but I wouldn't be super-excited about designing a large system with it. Although I suppose you guys did with LP. :-)\n<mkanat> I like that it forces you to have valid HTML that at least has closing tags and so on.\n<mkanat> And I like the convenience of putting stuff in attributes.\n<mkanat> But I think that after a while, it becomes very difficult to read, with everything in the attributes.\n<mkanat> Although that does encourage you to keep the templates simple.\n<mkanat> It's *very* hard to see the logic flow in a large template with a lot of tal:condition.\n<jam> beuno, mkanat: sites like this http://nick.zoic.org/2009/07/29/templates-fugit-3/ doen't make me think simpletal is all that fast. :)\n<jam> or this: http://nick.zoic.org/2010/04/\n<jam> though I think that is the same guy\n<mkanat> jam: Yeah, another reason I like Mako. :-)\n<mkanat> Besides the fact that it's the best template language I've ever used, possibly tied with the Template Toolkit.\n<mkanat> Well, I think I like Mako more in some ways, though.\n<beuno> jam, at the time, simpletal was as fast as the other engines we tried out\n<beuno> I implemented loggerhead in a few different engines\n<beuno> and our benchmarks where more or less the same or worst\n<beuno> so we went with that for familiarity\n<beuno> but, this was... 3 years ago?\n<mkanat> Yeah, I wouldn't imagine that the template language is a primary performance limiter on LP in any case.\n<jam> beuno: I can imagine that it would depend a lot on what you were doing with the template\n<jam> I do remember the discussions (though not in detail()\n<mkanat> Three years ago, I don't think Mako even existed.\n<maxb> Does anyone know, did Savannah ever get a helper to help with Loggerhead?\n<mkanat> maxb: Not that I know of.\n<jam> mkanat, beuno: My email archives show Mako being mentioned back in 2008-07-09 and also another 2008-07-10 proposal to use SimpleTAL\n<mkanat> jam: I think at that time Mako would have been brand new.\n<jam> with mwhudson saying: If we could get the same perf out of genshi, I would prefer it,\n<jam> and that simpletal is the \"fastest tree-based engine\"\n<jam> (from beuno)\n<jam> so the \"Tree-based\" was probably a familiarity factor\n<beuno> right, I did test genshi, and it was slower\n<beuno> yes, mwhudson really wanted something tree-based\n<jam> he seemed pretty happy with genshi, except the perf sucked :)\n<jam> mkanat: anyway, I don't think there is a strict requirement for simpletal, but there should be a strong reason to switch\n<jam> since it involves re-building all the dependencies, etc.\n<mkanat> jam: Okay. Yeah.\n<jam> mkanat: (so if you find that a page request is 0.1s bzrlib time, and 10s simpletal time, and mako would make that 0.01s mako time, that would be motivating. If it makes it 9s mako time, not so much, or if it is 10s bzrlib time, and 0.1s simpletal vs 0.00001s mako, etc)\n<mkanat> jam: Yeah, for sure.\n<mkanat> jam: I think what I would like about Mako would be the development advantages more than the speed advantages.\n<jam> well, you are currently the primary dev on it, but you won't always be :)\n<jam> Looking at the differences, I  do find TAL to be a bit strange\n<jam> the \"replace the current <> with this content\" is odd to me\n * mkanat nods.\n<jam> but then again here: http://www.makotemplates.org/\n<jam> having:\n<jam>     % for name in row:         <td>${name}</td>\\     % endfor\n<jam> is also really odd\n<mkanat> But much more readable.\n<jam> (lines with % are python control, but they output the content of lines that aren't %, etc)\n<jam> goes back to why I didn't like PHP\n<mkanat> Yeah, but that quality is pretty much extant in all template languages.\n<jam> I was never quite sure what got put out the pipe and what didn't\n<mkanat> I mean, that's pretty much the definition of a template language.\n<jam> never quite sure what was wrong with \"\"\"%(data)s\"\"\" % {'data': 'foo'}\n<mkanat> Well, a lot of things.\n<mkanat> One of the cool things that Mako has that no other template language has (that I know of) is inheritance.\n<lifeless> mkanat: I don't mind if you change the template language but...\n<lifeless> mkanat: it will make it harder for lp devs to debug and fix things.\n<mkanat> lifeless: Yeah.\n<mkanat> lifeless: I have no immediate plans to make any major changes like that.\n<jam> mkanat: I do seem to remember that rendering time was pretty long for stuff like the 'changes' page. about 50/50 IIRC\n<mkanat> jam: That wouldn't surprise me, I haven't tested that yet.\n<mkanat> jam: Sometimes rendering times are long because we are sending a generator from bzr though, too.\n<jam> mkanat: possible, though the bits I saw tend to list(bzr_stuff) before passing them over.\n<jam> anyway, glad you're working on it rather than me ATM.\n<mkanat> jam: :-)\n<jam> also, glad to see you working on it, period\n<jam> you went quiet for a bit, and I wasn't sure what was going on\n<mkanat> jam: I'm really glad you did the history_db stuff, though--I think for the most part that would have been much too high a level of bzr wizardry for me at this point. :-)\n<mkanat> jam: Yeah, some of it was getting contract details worked out, and then some of it was scheduling issues.\n<jam> mkanat: thanks, just need to actually get it deployed so it doesn't sit there languishing\n<mkanat> jam: Yeah, I want to deploy it more or less once we're ready for 2.0.\n<mkanat> jam: In any case, now I'm pretty active on loggerhead, and though my actions are somewhat limited, there's still a lot of stuff I'm planning to do.\n<achiang> hello, i'm trying to help a non-technical friend (she is a scientist, not a programmer) use bzr. she's created an LP account, downloaded bzr for windows, managed to pull source from LP, made a change, and committed it locally\n<achiang> now she is having issues pushing the branch back to LP\n<achiang> the error is:\n<achiang> Run command: bzr push \"bzr push lp:~lindsayvail/streamflow/newheader\\n\"\n<achiang> bzr: ERROR: Unsupported protocol for url \"bzr push lp:~lindsayvail/streamflow/newheader\n<achiang> \"\n<achiang> i guess that's coming from the windows gui tool, which i've never used\n<achiang> any hints?\n<achiang> ah, she reports that the command line is working for her\n<achiang> still, i'd like to know what we might be doing wrong in the windows tool.\n<jam> achiang: it at least sounds like she didn't install the lp plugin\n<achiang> jam: hm, didn't realize that was a required step\n<achiang> jam: thanks for the clue\n<jam> achiang: it is part of the installer\n<jam> it can be disabled, defaults to on\n<jam> achiang: if she was able to branch from the begininng from an lp: url, then that probably isn't it\n<jam> because it would work both ways\n<achiang> jam: interesting. i don't think she would have turned it off\n<jam> the other option\n<jam> is that she hasn't informed bzr of what account to use on LP\n<jam> I don't remember the gui way to do that\n<jam> the command line is \"bzr launchpad-login <lpusername>\"\n<achiang> nod\n<jam> achiang: I would have thought that would give more \"unable to push to http://...\" but it could be a secondary error\n<svz90> Hi. I had a quick question about bzr's ssh/sftp module. Is it possible to specify a custom ssh identity file (like with ssh -i somefile)?\n#bzr 2010-12-04\n<maxb> svz90: Easiest thing to do would be to configure it in your OpenSSH .ssh/config file\n<svz90> maxb: Thanks.\n<pattern> i've just done a \"bzr add foo\", but before i committed the change i changed my mind and i no longer want to add \"foo\"\n<pattern> how can i tell bzr i don't want to add \"foo\" anymore?\n<bob2> rm\n<bob2> --keep or whatever\n<renatosilva> english question: in a commit message like \"reverted changeset xyz\", reverted is past participle, not simple past, right? that is, changeset was reverted, not I reverted it.\n<Meths> As a commit message it would make more sense to say \"Reverts changeset xyz\" as the message should say what that changeset does.  But in the above either works really, not sure which way it would be interpreted by a grammer perfectionist though.\n<fullermd> I'd go with \"revert changeset\" myself.  Imperative FTW.\n<renatosilva> can it be read, is it usually read, as past participle?\n<renatosilva> is it \"undone commit 123.\", \"commit 123 undone.\", or \"undid commit 123.\"?\n<Meths> 3rd IMO\n<renatosilva> there's one guy saying 1st could be read as \"the commit has undone commit 123\"\n<renatosilva> and other guys saying \"commit 123 undone\" (\"commit 123 has been undone\") is ok, even though 3rd one is more usual\n<fullermd> vila: Around?\n<vila> fullermd: briefly, may I help ?\n<fullermd> I wondered if you've ever seen oddities of selftest on your FreeBSD vm with it locking itself up waiting on a semaphore.\n<vila> this doesn't ring any bell, FreeBSD (the babune slave) is on of the most stable (if the not *the* most)\n<vila> fullermd: is it something you've seen with an explicit output or only a weird behavior\n<vila> ?\n<fullermd> Well, for instance, http://babune.ladeuil.net:24842/job/selftest-freebsd/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/bzrlib.tests.blackbox.test_branch/TestSmartServerBranching/test_branch_from_trivial_branch_streaming_acceptance/?\n<fullermd> That one.\n<vila> while being stable it's also quite slow (compared to the others), but I don't have a good explanation for this\n<fullermd> If I run it via 'bzr selftest branch_streaming_acceptance', it runs fine.\n<fullermd> If I just like 'bzr selftest' hit it, it just stops dead.  python had 'usem' as a wchan in ps/top.  I've let it sit for 4 or 5 minutes, and gets nowhere.\n<vila> haaa interesting\n<fullermd> (runs in <3 seconds standalone)\n<fullermd> I've tried running a full selftest a half dozen times, and I keep finding new places further on that it locks down.\n<fullermd> Except last try around, where I foudn another place _early_ on that it started locking.  Gruuh.\n<vila> so, IIRC, that's a test which runs both a client and a server in the same process\n * fullermd nods.\n<fullermd> All the ones that lock are of that ilk AFAICS.\n<vila> I've been suspecting a weird interaction between python and BSDs (including OSX) but other OSes too (but quite differently) but I've never been able to diagnose precisely enough\n<vila> weird interaction around sockets\n<vila> some double handling of socket state (especially when both sides of the socket are used in the same process)\n<vila> but that's only a theory so far... and pretty weak :-/\n<fullermd> Mmm.  And you're using --parallel and somehow don't it it?\n<fullermd> (hit it)\n<vila> I do use --parallel yes\n<vila> well babune that is\n<fullermd> Annoyingly it seems like sometimes it sneaks past it fine.  Weird timing stuff; always works when it's part of a short list of tests being run.\n<vila> ha, that rings a bell\n<fullermd> Would make it easy enough to work around by running a couple times, if it didn't happen 5 or 10 minutes into a freakin' test run...\n * fullermd is now trying `./bzr selftest -x branch_streaming_acceptance -x test_create_clone_on_transport_use_existing_dir -x RemoteBranch -x RemoteBzr`.  Furrfu.\n<vila> my suspicion began when there was a bunch of sockets waiting to die which seem to slow the overall run\n<vila> which led me to suspect some select() call\n<vila> a bit like if python was relying on the OS to sort things out while.... somehow checking until it was happy with sleeps() intermixed... as you can see nothing very concrete\n * vila baktracks\n<vila> fullermd: you encounter hangs ?\n<fullermd> Except for me, python ends up waiting on a semaphore of some sort, so it never checks again.\n<fullermd> Well...  halting problem.  It COULD just be being very very slow, for 4 or 5 minutes, using no CPU and never waking up.\n<fullermd> But it sure smells like...  oh, look.\n * fullermd tries a-fscking-gain...\n * vila holds his breath...\n<vila> look what ?\n<vila> :D\n<fullermd> Oh, it locked itself again a thousand or so tests in.\n<vila> what's the flag... -Dthreads -Ethreads ?\n<vila> -Ethreads\n<vila> It was quite useful when debugging the leaks, but I think it was a but too intrusive and led to some failures (changing the output that some tests are checking), so be careful while encountering failures\n<fullermd> Well, we're 1600-some in to this attempt...\n<fullermd> Aaaand, it does.\n<vila> oh yes, lsof !\n<vila> lsof was also useful combined with -Ethreads whose output gives the socket references by tests\n<vila> both client and server side\n<fullermd> % fstat -p59868 | grep -c tcp\n<fullermd> 212\n<fullermd> That's a couple TCP sockets open...\n<vila> that's bad\n<vila> so, the other factor here is paramiko which leaves pending sockets\n<fullermd> Not a factor here.  I've had paramiko uninstalled for, like, a year and a half.\n<vila> but they can't be easily collected as they are internal to pa...\n<vila> damn\n<vila> one more theory dead\n * fullermd , slayer of theories!\n<fullermd> When you say -Ethreads, does that mean some sort of python internal threads, or does it use OS-level threads?\n<vila> python threads\n<vila> -Ethreads outputs debug statements at various \"interesting\" points\n<fullermd> There are 3 threads in the hung process.  One seems to be sitting in the 'accept' wchan, which I WAG may mean it's sitting in accept(2)...\n * vila hates vbox a bit more every day especially when killing one VM sometimes kill *all* the running VMs\n<vila> WAG ?\n<fullermd> Wild-Add Guess\n<vila> :)\n<vila> one thread for the accept(), one thread for the serving, one thread for the client (usually the main one)\n<vila> and by the way, the selftest in running with BZR_CONCURRENCY=4 and the VM has 2 processors configured\n<vila> s/in/is/\n<fullermd> Well, I'm not doing any --parallel'ing.\n<vila> I got that, just mentioning\n * fullermd nods.\n<vila> I'm running a straight selftest right now\n<fullermd> Oh, hey, it locked up only 197 in this time.\n<vila> with -Ethreads ?\n<fullermd> Only 16 TCP sockets open this time.\n<fullermd> Trying that out now.\n<vila> this... is surprising, I was pretty sure we collect almost all sockets now, except for the paramiko ones (which aren't relevant here)\n<vila> you're running bzr.dev there right ?\n<fullermd> Well, locked up, but I guess I should use -v too so's to have some idea where it is...\n<fullermd> Well, technically, this is bzr.dev+someotherchanges.  But nothing that would mess with network.\n<fullermd> Well, it dumps a pile of information, but I don't see how it's much useful...\n<vila> 2700 tests and running and fstat reports only 'internet stream tcp' lines, that's sockets right ?\n<fullermd> Yah.\n<fullermd> 'sockstat | grep python' should tell you what they are (well, unless you've got a lot of other stuff python running; then grep for the pid)\n<vila> it helps making sure the sockets are for past tests not the current ones and it also helps in finding which tests are leaking\n * fullermd frowns.\n<fullermd> Hm.\n<fullermd> I'm trying t selftest --no-plugins now.  That seems to clean up after itself pretty fast; I'm in the 500's now and nothing hanging around...\n<vila> right, ~4000 here and still no socket leaks (only 3 displayed)\n<fullermd> Oh, well, that was a good theory while it lasted.  Locked up.\n<vila> out of curiosity, what changes do you keep there ? Are you sure they aren't some gems worth proposing ? ;D\n<fullermd> Well, I WANT to propose them.  That's why I want selftest to run   :p\n<fullermd> Here's an interesting thing:\n<fullermd> USER     COMMAND    PID   FD PROTO  LOCAL ADDRESS         FOREIGN ADDRESS\n<vila> ha great :)\n<fullermd> fullermd python     60430 4  tcp4   127.0.0.1:39758       *:*\n<fullermd> fullermd python     60430 5  tcp4   127.0.0.1:39758       127.0.0.1:16483\n<fullermd> That's presumably the socket of the current test.  One of the threads is waiting in accept.  The socket is listening.  But there's also a connection made to it.\n<fullermd> That's on a test_pull_smart_stacked_[something]\n<vila> yes, could be the client and the accept() or the serving one, -Ethreads should help there no ?\n<vila> also, you should certainly see the mirrored one most of the time but if you happened to list while they are killed ?\n<fullermd> OK...\n<fullermd> ...nching.test_branch_from_trivial_branch_streaming_acceptanceServer thread ('127.0.0.1', 31415) started\n<fullermd> Client thread ('127.0.0.1', 10740) -> ('127.0.0.1', 31415) started\n<fullermd> fullermd python     60607 4  tcp4   127.0.0.1:31415       *:*\n<fullermd> fullermd python     60607 5  tcp4   127.0.0.1:31415       127.0.0.1:10740\n<fullermd> fullermd python     60607 6  tcp4   127.0.0.1:10740       127.0.0.1:31415\n<vila> 7000 and fstat is still clean as a baby, your 212 number above is still very weird\n<fullermd> Only tcp sockets open for the process.\n<fullermd> So it's got both sides of the connection open.  But one thread is still sitting in accept.\n<vila> sounds fine\n<fullermd> And it's dead there.\n<vila> there is one thread waiting in the accept, spawning a thread for serving each connection and accept'ing again\n<vila> dead and staying dead right now ?\n<vila> keep it alive !!!!\n<fullermd> Well, it's been a couple minutes...\n<vila> seriously,\n<vila> this is the dirty bit when shutting down a test server\n<vila> what's the test name ?\n<fullermd> ...nching.test_branch_from_trivial_branch_streaming_acceptance\n<vila> let me see\n<fullermd> In this case.  I don't think it matters though; it's semi-random.\n * fullermd just fired off a selftest in a virgin bzr.dev, just for kicks.\n<vila> could be, but I want to look at what kind of test server is involved and show you the relevant code so you may have your own take on it\n<vila> (not asking to debug it, but look at the code in a context where it seem to be failing )\n<fullermd> Man, the relevant code is python.  My take will be \"Hey, I can just rewrite that in perl...\"   :p\n<vila> hehe, no I mean as socket code, whatever the language, we're almost doing C there :)\n<fullermd> Remember, any test it's halted on yet, it works just peachy if I run it alone.\n<vila> ok, so that's a TestCaseWithTransport so it should be an http server\n<fullermd> Or in a small group.  It's only when I run a big enough group (e.g., a full selftest) that it semi-arbitrarily picks a time to lock itself up.\n<vila> I've seen very very very weird failures when chasing the leaks\n<vila> exactly\n<fullermd> Oh, there went virgin bzr.dev.\n<fullermd> | [1516/24890 in 3m27s, 1 failed] per_branch.test_branch.TestBranch.test_comm..\n<vila> bah, showing you the code is a bad idea, too many classes involved\n * fullermd has no class.\n<vila> ha, no, have a look at bt.test_server.TestingTCPServerInAThread.stop_server\n<vila> the dirty bit I was referring to is defined there: the server is blocked in an accept call, so we 1) tell him to stop acception connections (after getting out of it's current call), 2) give him a dummy connection\n<vila> there is also a if debug_threads():... call that you could copy/adapt/add in various points\n<vila> I suspect the case you encounter should be in this area but exhibit an unexpected behavior\n<vila> 14000 test and still clean\n<vila> hmm, IPV6 ?\n<fullermd> All those connections are over 127.0.0.1\n<vila> naah, you're running py2.6 right and anyway, I'm pretty sure I've used a variation of the right python code\n<vila> we've seen weird things even when using only ipv4 for us, as long as the host is configured for ipv6, (paramiko at least as a bug for this kind of config)\n<vila> most of the time we force ipv4 by using 127.0.0.1 but some tests may still use localhost and went unnoticed\n<vila> we have some fugitives like that here and there ;D\n<fullermd> Just switch it to force ipv6 by using ::1 instead.  If their system doesn't support v6 yet, set it in fire; better for everyone that way   :p\n<vila> hehe\n<vila> 18000 and still clean, babune:~ :) $ fstat -p1004 |wc -l\n<vila>       12\n<vila> but if you encounter the problem with bzr.dev and --no-plugins that should rule your proposal out :)\n<vila> 20000 and raising briefly at ~40 (paramiko), back at 12\n<fullermd> It doesn't seem to [generally] do any notable accumulation of stuff over time.  Most of the locks have no sockets except the current ones.\n<vila> but when it blocks it's on a socket right ?\n<vila> and one in the accept() state ? (with no foreign address ?)\n<fullermd> Yah.\n<vila> or are you unsure about that ?\n<fullermd> Well, I'm not _sure_ insofar as I've dug into the stack.  But that's what everything looks like.\n<vila> so, I encounter weird things when trying the kill-the-socket-with-shutdown approach IIRC\n<vila> I tried various ways with mixed results until I ended up giving it a dummy connection and even there I think I tried various tricks before settling on a simple close()\n<vila> that's why I suggested adding some sys.stderr.write in this area but if you're blocked on a case where there is no foreign address...\n<vila> it kind of means that this last_conn didn't succeed ?\n<vila> or did you even not reach reach the point where 'Server thread %s will be joined' ? Or is this message not flushed ? <shudder>\n<fullermd> I don't recall ever seeing joins on the locks.\n<vila> oook\n<fullermd> See the one I pasted ~half hour ago.  The \"Client thread started\" is the last thing that shows up.\n<fullermd> As if the server thread sat in accept() waiting for the client thread (which the OS sees as connected), and never got out of accept().\n<vila> that part is expected, the server thread has spawned another thread\n<vila> what isn't expected is that this spawned thread can't finish (or its related client thread)\n * fullermd sighs.\n<vila> the client thread being the main thread\n<fullermd> It sucks trying to figure out why changes were made when you can't ask the maker   :|\n<vila> so, this kind of hang is the hardest\n<vila> which changes ?\n<fullermd> The ones I'm working on cleaning up, which led me to trying selftest in the first place.\n<vila> which changes ? :D\n<fullermd> upgrade enhancements.\n<vila> ha :-/\n<vila> err, may I misinterpreted here, you mean in upgrade.py ?\n<fullermd> Yah.\n<vila> qblame mentions only living people, so you should be able to reach them no ?\n<fullermd> Yes, that would be for the existing merged code, not the outstanding unmerged.\n<fullermd> Which is igc   :(\n<vila> ha, I didn't misinterpreted :-/\n<vila> you're digging an old mp ?\n<fullermd> https://code.launchpad.net/~bzr/bzr/smooth-upgrades/+merge/8921\n * vila reading\n<vila> by the way, the selftest succeeded here with only: bzrlib.tests.test_smart_transport.TestServerHooks.test_server_started_hook_memory is leaking threads among 2 leaking tests.\n<vila> 1 non-main threads were left active in the end.\n<vila> hmm, lots of stuff there ;-/ Nice to see you working on it, I should leave now, but I'll be pp next week and will look at anything you'll submit, so feel free to begin with high level questions or even re-start the discussion on the ML\n<vila> --pack should be useless, --cleanup I think has been implemented elsewhere, so it's worth having a look at that while it still makes sense to propose it there (I went with a bunch of upgrades lately and could have used it)\n<fullermd> You're thinking of pack --clean-obsolete-packs I think.\n<jelmer> fullermd: that's an interesting mp\n<fullermd> Yeah, it should be a real nice addition to 2.0.0   :|\n<jelmer> :-P\n<fullermd> 's one of the things whose continued absense pisses me off.  I don't really have time or inclination to work on it, but I have even less of both to keep not having it.  Sigh.\n<fullermd> vila: Just dropped what I could do on it.  Enjoy your piloting   :)\n<nonix4> if revision x in branch a adds file c, and revision y in branch b adds file d, where d is actually descendant of c... is there a simple way to tell that to bzr after both commits have been made? (both mentioned revisions containing other unrelated changes as well)\n<fullermd> I'm not sure what you mean by \"descendant\".  But the answer will be \"no\".  Once you've made a revision in the current World Order, it's too late to go back and tell bzr more about it.\n<nonix4> except for uncommit?\n<fullermd> Well, semantics.  Even uncommit doesn't change a revision, it just pops things off the top of the history and throws them away.\n<fullermd> There is occasional discussion about ways to _annotate_ information after the fact (specifically to this case, things like equivalences between separate files).  But it's all speculative and far-future, which doesn't help anything now.\n<nonix4> well... how about cherry-picking creation of one file from a distant branch?\n<fullermd> You could do that.  Being a cherry-pick, it wouldn't record any of the revision info.  But it would use the same file-id.\n<mgz> ah, was going to ask about the 'local oddities' fullermd ran into with the test suite, but I see it's in the history so I'll just read up.\n<mgz> I'd be interested if lp:~gz/bzr/cleanup_testcases_by_collection_613247 helped though, I recall freebsd has som lower default resource limits than other nixes so leaks could hurt\n<lifeless> hi mgz\n<lifeless> mgz: if you're interested in testrepository, I would love to know if trunk still works on win32\n<mgz> hm, looks more like 's just theclient-server tests being dodgy still from the log\n<mgz> lifeless: I'll pull and test.\n<lifeless> thanks!\n<lifeless> mgz: its specifically 'testr run' I'm hacking on\n<lifeless> mgz: I've added a SIGPIPE fixup for unix\n<lifeless> but that may bork win32 subprocess invocations\n<mgz> hm, some kind of import issue\n<mgz> I wish the framework didn't hide that stuff\n<lifeless> ?\n<mgz> ...

For most of the packages I want to do I am upstream and I want to set it up and then forget about it\n<jelmer> robert_ancell: that works for us too, because we end up updating the debian/changelog version when we do a release\n<jelmer> robert_ancell: and then do a matching upload to debian/ubuntu\n<robert_ancell> jelmer, I know I'll forget to do it :)\n<jelmer> robert_ancell: you're not uploading to ubuntu ? :-)\n<jelmer> (we use the same branch for ubuntu packaging as for the daily PPA)\n<robert_ancell> jelmer, no, these are daily builds to a PPA for upstream testers\n<robert_ancell> the Ubuntu packaging has some patches, merges from Debian and may not be running the latest version\n<jelmer> robert_ancell: in that case you'd probably indeed want to wait for the 0.4 support\n<robert_ancell> jelmer, thanks for the help\n<poolie> so apparently if you call accept from one thread and connect from another, python can sometimes deadlock in futex()\n<poolie> nice\n<lifeless> on different sockets?\n<poolie> on the two sides of the same socketpair\n<poolie> simulating a server in process\n<lifeless> interesting\n<poolie> ie this fixes it http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mbp/bzr/2.5-client-reconnect-819604/revision/6209#bzrlib/tests/test_bundle.py\n<poolie> \"fixes\"\n<poolie> the loop doesn't fix it, only changing to a nonblocking select\n<lifeless> possibly accept isn't giving up the GIL ?\n<poolie> seems likely\n<poolie> i guess i should see if i can reproduce it and file a bug\n<poolie> it's kind of a stupid thing to do imo\n<spiv> It pretty clearly releases the GIL in 2.7.2: http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/8527427914a2/Modules/socketmodule.c#l1656\n<poolie> hm\n<spiv> In the past all our sockets+threads deadlocks have turned out to be bugs in our logic, not cpython\n<poolie> :)\n<poolie> that does seem likely\n<poolie> but, strace shows one side in accept and one in futex\n<poolie> ...\n<spiv> (Although arguably perhaps because the APIs offered aren't as convenient/safe as one might hope?)\n<poolie> the futex not being released by getting eintr from accept\n<poolie> when i say it's stupid i mean i think running the server inprocess is a bit likely to fail\n<poolie> anyhwo\n<spiv> Well, that shows that one side is in accept, and the other side is stuck in a lock \u00e2\u0080\u0094 quite possibly a lock owned by pure Python code (e.g. a threading.Mutex in a Queue.Queue)\n<poolie> that is possible\n<spiv> It would be extremely helpful if strace could magically distinguish between \"Python VM internal lock\" and \"Lock exposed to Python application code\"\n<lifeless> pytrace is pretty good at that\n<lifeless> (gdb + py* macros I mean)\n<poolie> i was excited for a second there\n<poolie> i'll try to hit it again and use gdb\n<poolie> it's inside lock_PyThread_acquire_lock\n<poolie> ah inside threading.join?\n<spiv> poolie: doesn't sound like a vm bug :P\n<poolie> :)\n<poolie> ah :)\n<poolie> apparently closing a socket does not interrupt threads that are accepting on that socket\n<poolie> so that explains why alternating selecting and accepting avoids the problem\n<spiv> That sounds familiar.\n<poolie> yeah\n<poolie> spiv, so basically the patch is reasonable but the explanation is wrong\n<vila> hi all !\n<poolie> hi there vila\n<vila> poolie: hmm, what patch and explanation are you talking about ?\n<poolie> i think i understand why that was hanging\n<vila> great !

A is a parent of B. Can I do it without needing to create the two branches t_A and t_B?\n<knielsen> `bzr log -n0 -rA..B` does not work when A is not the primary (main-line) parent of B\n<knielsen> `bzr missing` has --my-revision and --revision arguments, but again it seems not to work for non-mainline parents (the docs seem unhelpful for this)\n<vila> knielsen: doesn't 'bzr log -n0 -rA..B --exclude-common-ancestry' work ?\n<jelmer> vila: with the same requests?\n<vila> jelmer: yes\n * knielsen checking\n<jelmer> vila: pulled into lp:~bzr/bzr/2.5-client-reconnect-819604\n<knielsen> vila: no, it doesn't work. `bzr log -n0 -rA..B` is missing a changeset that `bzr missing` shows (and --exclude-common-ancestry does not help with this)\n * vila curses complicated log implementation\n<vila> knielsen: you know branch accepts a --no-tree parameter ? Branches are way cheaper to create this way if you have a big working tree\n<knielsen> the obvious answer would be `bzr missing --include-merges --my-revision=A --revision=B .`, but I could not get this to work, in fact I could not get --my-revision to do anything for some reason...\n<knielsen> vila: yes, probably will need to go with explicit branches and --no-tree\n<knielsen> should be ok, though I need to do this for a couple of 1000 revisions\n<vila> if '--revision A --revision B' is accepted, it should translate to '-rA..B' or nothing is really wrong\n<fullermd> knielsen: Don't overlook that you don't need to keep creating new branches for all those thousand.  You can just create A and B branches once, and use 'pull' in 'em to reset their revs for each run.\n<knielsen> fullermd: right, interesting idea, might help\n<fullermd> (and with them in a shared repo with your source branch, all those resets will be cheap, since no data needs to be transferred)\n<vila> knielsen: 1.000 revisions... I can't imagine what you're trying to achieve...\n<knielsen> hehe. I'm trying to get an overview of a very complicated merge. I have a list of commits that were merged and pushed into a tree in sequence, and I want to for each one know how many revisions were merged in that push\n<knielsen> and I just wanted to try understand how `bzr log` worked with non-mainline revision ranges. But `bzr branch --no-tree` branches several trees per second, so I think that will be plenty sufficient for my needs\n<knielsen> tnx for the help\n<vila> knielsen: did you give 'bzr qlog' a shot ? It's pretty good at showing which revisions were merged into each mainline revision\n * knielsen will try qlog also ...\n<vila> It may be slow to start (for big & complex histories), but you'll start it only once\n<knielsen> vila: the main thing is that the mainline revisions do not correspond to the pushes into the tree, as there has been no discipline about in which order to merge before pushing\n<vila> You can also give several branches and it gives a pretty good view of what has been merged\n<vila> knielsen: argh, yeah, makes it hard to understand what is shared :-/\n<knielsen> so I re-constructed a list of the commits that existed in the main tree during time. Many of these commits are not mainline revision, and many main-line revisions are not on the list\n<vila> knielsen: append_revisions_only is your friend to converge to such a workflow\n<knielsen> vila: yep :)\n<jelmer> vila: do you have any plugins loaded when running the testsuite?\n<vila> jelmer: I ran with BZR_PLUGIN_PATH=-site\n<jelmer> vila: found it - we override verbs in the testsuite, but don't cope with info=\n<vila> jelmer: where ?\n<jelmer> vila: override_verb() and disable_verb()\n<vila> ha, right, bad cleanup, I see\n<jelmer> vila: can you try again with my last commit to ~bzr/bzr/2.5-client-reconnect-819604 ?\n<vila> revno 6217\n<vila> running\n<vila> jelmer: right fix, confirming isolation issue, note that the proper (and usual way) to do that is to overiddeAttr(request.request_handler) and populate it with a copy (out of scope for your branch)\n<vila> jelmer: run succeeded, the fix is good\n<vila> I got one spurious failure though:\n<vila> bzrlib.tests.per_interrepository.test_fetch.TestInterRepository.test_fetch_parent_inventories_at_stacking_boundary_smart_old(InterDifferingSerializer,RepositoryFormatKnitPack6RichRoot,RepositoryFormat2a)\n<vila> with a slightly different error for the client: ConnectionReset: Connection closed: Unexpected end of message.

I can't find the recipe on any of the branches\n<Wellark> there has to be one as the daily ppa sends me build error emails\n<Wellark> the build uses these branches: https://code.launchpad.net/~indicator-network-developers/ofono/trunk, https://code.launchpad.net/~indicator-network-developers/ofono/trunk.packaging\n<Wellark> but both of those branches say: No recipes using this branch.\n<Wellark> I'm a bit puzzled now\n<jelmer> Wellark: how did you create the recipe?\n<Wellark> no, somebody created it before\n<Wellark> now, I'm suppose to continue development and maintenance of those packages and I'm trying to figure out all the pieces of the puzzle\n<Wellark> s/no/no, I didn't create it my self/\n<Wellark> jelmer: do you have some powertool to list the recipes which land stuff to this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~indicator-network-developers/+archive/daily-ppa ?\n<jelmer> Wellark: usually I just look for recipes owned by the same user that owns the PPA\n<jelmer> Wellark: based on the versions of the packages in that PPA, it seems like those packages weren't created by a recipe\n<jelmer> Wellark: it's probably just somebody (a bot?) doing daily source package uploads\n<Wellark> sigh...\n<vila> jelmer, mgz: I'm looking at some import failure and I encounter a weird case you may help me to understand, get the branches for debootstrap -rtag:1.0.36 for oneiric, sid and wheezy, launch qlog on them  and tell me it's not as bad as I fear :-/\n<jelmer> vila: hmm, it seems like the debian and ubuntu branches have parallel imports?\n<jelmer> vila: seems like it was caused by the fact that ubuntu diverged for a bit, then discarded its changes\n<mgz> hm.\n<jelmer> vila: it diverged in 1.0.29ubuntu1, and then discarded that\n<vila> but the tags '1.0.xx' should be for upstream no ?\n<vila> they seem to exist with different revids in debian and ubuntu\n<jelmer> vila: there is no upstream in this case\n<jelmer> vila: it is a native package\n<vila> surely the same tag can't be used for different revs ?\n<vila> even for native packages\n<vila> and the picture is even more fun when you add the precise branch :-/\n<jelmer> vila: different branches can have different tags\n<vila> right, that's the theory, but does it make sense here ?\n<jelmer> vila: in this case bzr-builddeb doesn't pull from the Debian branch anymore because it sees the Ubuntu and the Debian branch have diverged\n<vila> precise merged them\n<mgz> this branch is a little large for my connection, it's not finished yet.\n<mgz> there we go.\n<vila> mgz: oh, sorry :-( ~133MB\n<jelmer> vila: please file a bug against bzr-builddeb\n<vila> jelmer: so, debian and ubuntu, for native packages, having the same tag used for different versions is expected ?\n<vila> jelmer: I'm trying to understand first, I'm not sure builddeb is at fault here, the failure is udd so far and it seems it assumes a tag cannot point to different revs there\n<vila> s/udd/in udd/\n<vila> jelmer: so, debian and ubuntu, for native packages, having the same tag used for different versions is expected ?\n<jelmer> vila: no, that's not expected\n<vila> what tags should they use then ?\n<vila> x.y.zdebianN and x.y.z.ubuntuN ?\n<mgz> okay, I see the pretty picture.\n<jelmer> vila: the tag names aren't the issue\n<jelmer> vila: it's the fact that bzr-builddeb doesn't pull from the debian branch to import those revisions, and then reimports them itself.\n<jelmer> vila: and when it reimports htem itself, they end up with new revision ids and tags\n<vila> ha\n<vila> so the ubuntu ones are wrong is what you're saying ?\n<jelmer> vila: when 1.0.30 was synced from debian to ubuntu, that discarded 1.0.29ubuntu1\n<jelmer> vila: yes\n<jelmer> it would be interesting to see if you can reproduce this issue by taking the ubuntu branch at 1.0.29ubuntu1 and then trying to import the 1.0.30 package\n<vila> but the parents of the ubuntu 1.0.30 are 1.0.29ubuntu1 *and* debian 1.0.30\n<jelmer> vila: the parents of ubuntu 1.0.30 should be 1.0.29 only\n<jelmer> vila: it should be the same revision as debian 1.0.30\n<jelmer> vila: what happened is basically the equivalent of \"bzr push --overwrite\"\n<vila> meh, 1.0.29ubuntu1 cannot be part of debian right ? Oh, you mean 1.0.29ubuntu1 shouldn't be there *at all* anymore ?\n<jelmer> vila: right, it shouldn't be there anymore at all\n<jelmer> vila: if you look at the current changelog.gz, you'll also see it's not there\n<vila> which the 1.0.30 merge shows in its associated diff yes\n<vila> I suspect the package importer have no idea this can occur\n<vila> so both may need to be fixed (importer and buildeb)\n<vila> no, wait, something is wrong here\n<vila> say 1.0.29 was for lucid and then 1.0.30 for maverick, I still want 1.0.29 to be there so I can make other dot releases for lucid, as long as the content for 1.0.30, the prior history shouldn't need to be altered\n<vila> s/as the content/& is correct/\n<jelmer> vila: I'm not sure I follow?\n<vila> you said 'right, it shouldn't be there anymore at all' , that sounds excessive\n<jelmer> in the revision graph for the oneiric branch, 1.0.29ubuntu1 shouldn't be present at all\n<vila> the tags was a red herring as you explain, knowing they are legit, the branches don't look that weird now\n<jelmer> 1.0.29, 1.0.30, etc should be present in the oneiric branch\n<vila> 1.0.29ubuntu1 commit says: 'Cherry-pick from trunk:' so it has been released right  (in natty) ?\n<vila> why should it disappear from the history in this case ?\n<vila> it seem the branches converge again at 1.0.30 if they can have different revs for the same tag, what's the issue ?\n<jelmer> vila: it's like bzr release series\n<vila> endless superfluous merges ?\n<jelmer> vila: it's possible to cherry-pick a change from trunk onto 2.1 but it will become a different revision, and that different revision isn't in lp:bzr\n<vila> right, but it's still part of the 2.1 history and becomes part of bzr.dev history when merged up\n<jelmer> vila: there was no up-merging from ubuntu into debian here though\n<jelmer> vila: which is why that revision shouldn't be part of the oneiric history\n<vila> right and they will never be because ubuntu is downstream and has a larger history\n<jelmer> vila: ubuntu oneiric has the exact same history as debian sid at the moment\n<jelmer> vila: they're both shipping 1.0.38\n<vila> but their branches are different, same content because ubuntu merges debian but still different histories\n<jelmer> vila: the ubuntu natty branch *should* have 1.0.29ubuntu1\n<jelmer> vila: their branches should be the same, like for any package where ubuntu doesn't have a delta\n<vila> we seem to agree about the branch content but disagree about the branch history\n<jelmer> vila: about what should be in the branch history you mean?\n<vila> the oneiric history should be a subset of the natty history so 1.0.29ubuntu1 should also be part of oneiric\n<vila> yes\n<vila> grr\n<vila> s/subset/superset/ of course\n<vila> or not ?\n<jelmer> vila: I don't think it should be a superset, it doesn't reflect what has actually happened\n<vila> are you saying the history can somehow be restarted when a new ubuntu release is started ?\n<vila> so the natty branch and the oneiric one can really diverge and never be reconciled ?\n<vila> my understanding was that launchpad was always creating the new release branches from the previous release...\n<jelmer> vila: sure - the same thing happens e.g. with SRUs\n<jelmer> james_w: around?\n<vila> right, but SRU happen *after* the branches have been bootstrapped\n<vila> miss an s, here are some ssss\n<jelmer> vila: the bootstrapping and old branches don't really matter I think\n<jelmer> vila: the point is that when ubuntu discards its changes for a package, we should reflect that in the history\n * vila blinks\n<vila> by removing a revision ?\n<jelmer> vila: effectively, what ubuntu is doing is:\n<jelmer> taking a debian, making some local changes to it\n<jelmer> taking a debian package (1.0.29), making some local changes to it and uploading that (1.0.29ubuntu1)\n<vila> recording that in the branh history\n<jelmer> then later, when e.g. the fixes in 1.0.29ubuntu1 have been applied upstream too, they discard their version of it\n<jelmer> \"bzr pull --overwrite debianlp:debootstrap\"\n<jelmer> so they again have the same history as debian\n<vila> wow\n<vila> and no trace that 1.0.29ubuntu1 ever existed ?\n<jelmer> right - see debian/changelog in e.g. 1.0.37, no sign that 1.0.29ubuntu1 was ever there\n<vila> hehe, touche\n<vila> hmm\n<vila> right, so I see your point\n<vila> I don't think it is what is implemented yet though,\n<vila> but I can imagine that the failures are related\n<vila> I'll big further tomorrow, thanks for the explanations and the discussion\n<vila> s/big.... ???/dig/\n<jelmer> :) see you tomorrow\n<vila> hmm, and the tag should be deleted too, everywhere :) ...\n<jelmer> vila: not everywhere, just those ubuntu releases that no longer have the version..\n<vila> ha ! Who is making things harder now ! :0D\n<jelmer> vila: I don't think that's making things harder - it's just one of the things we should do when we do the \"bzr pull --overwrite\" from debian\n<vila> yeah, was mostly kidding.\n<vila> --overwrite may have a lot of unforeseen fallouts is what I meant, people having mirrors and so on\n<vila> or pending proposals\n<Wellark> hmm.. I'm trying to write a recipe\n<Wellark> my .recipe file contains:\n<jelmer> vila: I don't think we necessarily handle that very well at the moment, as we record the parent but don't actually have the changes from 1.0.29ubuntu1\n<vila> anyway, food for thougt, first of all, fixing the imports ;) EOD, have fun !\n<Wellark> # bzr-builder format 0.4 deb-version {debupstream}-0ubuntu1+bzr{revno}+bzr{revno:packaging}\n<jelmer> vila: g'night & g'appetite :)\n<Wellark> but running $bzr dailydeb gives me an error\n<Wellark> bzr: ERROR: Invalid deb-version: {debupstream}-0ubuntu1+bzr5947+bzr2792: Invalid version string '{debupstream}-0ubuntu1+bzr5947+bzr2792'\n<Wellark> so it seems that {depupstream} doesn't get substituted\n<jelmer> Wellark: what's the full recipe?\n<Wellark> jelmer: $ cat ofono.recipe\n<Wellark> # bzr-builder format 0.4 deb-version {debupstream}-0ubuntu1+bzr{revno}+bzr{revno:packaging}\n<Wellark> ofono.trunk\n<Wellark> arg,,\n<Wellark> argh.\n<Wellark> jelmer: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/755157/\n<jelmer> Wellark: does ofono.trunk have a debian/ directory?

Can you use a lp:~bzr branch so I can push there too ?\n<vila> poolie: in other news, I requeue a bunch of imports yesterday,\n<poolie> great\n<poolie> good idea about a team branch\n<vila> ~20 now succeeds, ~50 moved from one kind of failure to another, I started digging the find_unimported_versions:check (74 failures) ones which led to an interesting discussion with jelmer\n<poolie> nice work\n<vila> the 74 failures may also be related to the other 43 ones from find_unimported_versions (no :check)\n<poolie> speaking of which, i wasn't sure if you heard the other day i made your terrine\n<poolie> vaguely speaking of which\n<vila> really ?? Great ! So ?\n<poolie> it was good\n<vila> :)\n<poolie> your corrections were on point - it would have been too salty otherwise etc\n<poolie> :)\n<vila> I'm glad you enjoyed it :) Will tell my friend his recipe went around the world ;)\n<vila> poolie: and did you manage with the advices about how ti find if it's cooked or not ?\n<vila> s/ti/to/\n<poolie> i did\n<poolie> i used a thermometer too\n<vila> cheater :)\n<poolie> i think it could have done with a little less time\n<poolie> anyhow i thought it might please or amuse you to know\n<vila> oooh, that reminds me that I cheat too (yeah, thanks, pleased and amused indeed):\n<vila> I made several terrine in various sizes so the smaller ones are finished first and help get the biggest one right\n<poolie> ok https://code.launchpad.net/~bzr/bzr/doc/+merge/84069\n<vila> and also allow the chief to taste before serving ;)\n<poolie> :)\n<poolie> ok\n<poolie> i've pushed my stuff\n<poolie> i think i'll log off soon\n<vila> waiting for lp to refresh\n<vila> enjoy your evening (and week-end right ?)\n<poolie> this was leading up to changing to append_revisions_only\n<poolie> thanks, yes\n<vila> yeah, I've seen your bug comment,\n<vila> the last experience we did was on the importer but I need to refresh my memory about why we reverted it and whether or not it should block making it the default (I strongly hope not)\n<vila> and yes, -Oappend_revisions_only should work (and if not, should be fixed)\n<vila> and yes, -Oappend_revisions_only=False should work (and if not, should be fixed)\n<mgz> morning!\n<vila> mgz: hey !\n<poolie> vila so was my patch actually correct?\n<poolie> :/\n<vila> which one ?\n<vila> I haven't see a patch for a_r_o yet, but I agree (strongly) with the intent\n<poolie> the doc thing\n<poolie> anyhow\n<poolie> not a big deal\n<poolie> i'm not going to finish a_r_o this week, i think\n<vila> yup, doc thing sounds good, perfect for driving my answers\n<vila> there is one important thing missing though: which stack you chose for a given option defines where it can be defined and where the modifications will be made\n<vila> i.e. GlobalStack or BranchStack for example\n<vila> weird, nexuiz-data is at it again, consuming 4GB without any obvious output...

I did it on a box at home but now can't get it working here.\n<mgz> what I've done is `dpkg-reconfigure locales` to get some non-english ones, and then set LAND and LC_ALL and use locale.setlocale\n<mgz> but... that seems to not be enough\n<vila> mgz: LANG but yeah should do\n<mgz> yeah, that was just an IRC tyop.\n<vila> mgz: on the other hand, I'm definitely the one to ask for that: I switch to C decades ago and never looked bac k;)\n<vila> this is supposed to Just Work, with additional tweaks via LANG\n<mgz> okay, fail at that, dug up another bug by accident instead\n<mgz> worked it out at second try, also have LANGUAGE env var that breaks things\n<vila> OS ?\n<mgz> ehem.\n<vila> we do weird stuff about locales in the bzr script itself too\n<vila> oh, That one ;)\n<mgz> no, not windows, it's easy on windows :)\n<vila> debian ?\n<mgz> yup.\n<mgz> okay, it's working.\n<mgz> now tempted to see if I can close a long standing bug without even having the change any code...\n<mgz> should be able to run a full selftest even on this machine now the test suite cleans itself up better\n<vila> yak shaving *is* useful ;)\n<vila> jelmer: no wonder doc/developers/plans.txt fell of my radar, it's not part of the online site... something weird happened years ago\n<vila> ha, no, it's part of the sphinx generated docs not the regular ones\n<mgz> still a little memory constrained, errors on fork\n<mgz> trying again with X gone should do it though.\n<jelmer> vila: did you see mydiscusion with james yesterday here on IRC?\n<vila> jelmer: yup, was waiting for you to summarize,\n<vila> so, we keep the upload history,\n<vila> yet, I found your idea interesting too, so longer term we may want to investigate, it sounds like a useful optimization\n<vila> overall, there is more than one history ;)\n<jelmer> yeah, there is some tension here between convenience for packagers and keeping all history\n * vila nods\n<mgz> two failures, I think both were known random ones\n<vila> what's the difference between random and spurious in English ?\n<vila> (in the context of test failures I mean, not in general)\n<mgz> spurious implies the failure isn't meaningful, but may always happen\n<mgz> random implies the failure may or may not happen, but might be meaningful\n<vila> thks\n<mgz> some of our issues may be both spurious and random (the test test server ones), but some of the races are random but not spurious\n<mgz> (they could in theory be hit in general usage)\n<mgz> are views documented anywhere? does anything currently use them?\n<mgz> bt.test_sftp_transport.test_bad_connection_ssh fails if paramiko is not installed\n<vila> are your two last messages related ?\n<vila> views are used by some people AIUI\n<vila> bt...bad_connection should use requireFeature, we *have* a paramiko one right >\n<vila> yup, features.paramiko\n<mgz> unrelated, just doing other things while tests run\n<mgz> hm, and the test does use that require\n<mgz> wonder what's going on (apart from general bogosity of using run_bzr outside blackbox)\n<mgz> ...ah, actuallyrun_bzr_subprocess so probably a path issue\n<vila> more MalformedTransform bugs on jubany. Joy ;)\n<mgz> your favourite :)\n<vila> hehe, looks like I'm making progress at using tree transform ;)\n<mgz> so two bugs, one is that run_bzr_subprocess doesn't get my path right, the other is that this test sucks.\n<vila> LOL\n<vila> and trying the version proposed in the comment ?\n<vila> even hardy uses python-paramiko-1.6.4 so that may be worth a try\n<vila> yesterday results of poking jubany: http://webnumbr.com/ubuntu-package-import-failures.from%282011-11-01%29\n<vila> back to where we were 3 weeks ago :)\n<mgz> it looks like the commented version may be a happier route indeed, if the only flaw was some ssh kipple\n<jelmer> mgz: we do seem to be playing whack-a-mole with unicode bugs, rather than actively trying to find and squash them :(\n<jelmer> I do wonder if python3 (and an attempt to port to it) would be helpful in that regard.\n<jelmer> or to phrase it differently - being explicit about what is encoded and what are bytes would both help our existing python2 version of bzr, and porting to python3\n<mgz> I'm still tempted by the idea of objectizing paths, but that's not clearly a win\n<mgz> the current state of bytes input, get unicode paths, change to utf-8 for dirstate, maybe change back to unicode for reporting error... is not ideal\n<jelmer> mgz: being forced to use non-bytestring paths on Linux is frustrating\n<mgz> the transcoding could be avoided, what we really want is validation though\n<mgz> which you can't easily do in python except by .decode(...)\n<vila> but you proposed (in that mail ;) some escaping scheme that could be used. With objectized (sp?) paths, this will at least be done in a single place. Obj... paths would also provide a simpler API\n<vila> ideally we'll still accept <whatever> in the current API and start throwing deprecation warnings\n<vila> since neither approach (whack-a-mole / all paths as objects) can be done in one go, starting both would at least make the goal clearer\n<vila> The alternative name of 'safe_utf8' is 'break_things_randomly' :-D\n<jelmer> vila: its name is kindof ironic\n<vila> just found that in mgz's review, burst out laughing because I was expecting an explanation so the joke really took me off-guard :)\n<vila> the most scary is that I'm pretty sure I used it in the past, with confidence, and I can't remember where :-}\n<jelmer> mgz: can we deprecate it?\n<vila> not a lot of uses left according to grep, good surprise\n<chromaticwt> is there a way to push a bzr repo to github?\n<mgz> jelmer, vila: there are lots of things in osutils that would ideally be deprecated\n<mgz> it's a bit too tempting to just dump stuff in there.\n<mgz> chromaticwt: it's possible to push to github with bzr, but you'd need a (git) branch registered via the site already to target\n<vila> mgz: yup, lots of things to clean up there\n<mgz> okay, bug half one worked out and fixed.\n<mgz> test machinery sets $HOME which then breaks the site module's path addition if run_user_subprocess is run\n<vila> huh ? Why would tests use site modules ?\n<vila> talk about isolation...\n<mgz> 'site' is the (ugly) module that runs at python startup and does things like filling in bits of the sys module\n<mgz> one part of that is adding things to sys.path\n<vila> ha, sorry\n<vila> but what kind of $HOME can break that ?\n<vila> isn't it a case where TestCase is used where TestCaseInTempDir should /\n<vila> ?\n<mgz> if HOME is set to a tempdir, when the site module tries to add my user specific python packages in ~/.local it's looking relative to that tempdir\n<mgz> hence, self.requireFeature(features.paramiko) passes, but the spawned subprocess says there's no paramiko\n<mgz> I have a fix.\n<vila> there is no .local dir there, so should be fine or is it that '~' needs to be expanded ?\n * vila blinks and wait to see the fix :)\n<mgz> ~/.local expands to /home/martin/.local in the selftest process, but for the subprocess the test spawns it expands to /tmp/bzr/....\n<vila> and you installed paramiko in ~/.local\n<mgz> right.\n<vila> I'm stil surprised requireFeature() works...\n<vila> does it means it is first called when $HOME is valid ?\n<mgz> paramiko works from bzr - I run bzr as me.\n<mgz> site does it's path lookup once at python startup\n<vila> argh\n<mgz> so bzr gets the right module paths... unless spawned from within a testcase where we set $HOME\n<vila> so what ? We need to force a PYTHONPATH ?\n<vila> this vaguely rings a bell\n<fullermd> Nono, just copy everything in it into the tempdir!\n<vila> didn't run_bzr_subprocess already tweak the env ?\n<mgz> nearly - there's actually a more targetted envvar we can use instead\n<mgz> PYTHONUSERBASE\n<vila> jelmer: looks like import_upstream blows up if a symlink is turned into a dir (probably a packaging mistake) this leads to http://package-import.ubuntu.com/status/rserve.html#2011-12-01%2011:18:38.327140\n<vila> reproduced locally when importing 0.5-3 where clients is now an exact copy of src/client instead of clients -> src/client\n<mgz> that sounds similar to an error that the path name encoding branch fix exposed as well\n<vila> jelmer: does that ring a bell ?\n<mgz> I think the logic is just old and incorrect.\n<vila> mgz: more context ?\n<mgz> ikiwiki\n<mgz> slightly different place, but I think the problem is similar.\n<vila> in my case, the code involved try to handle renames but this is a kind change (symlink -> dir)\n<mgz> basically the custom transform in bzrtools_import is complicated, a little buggy, and not maintained\n<vila> ha\n<mgz> we've done fixes for this symlink stuff in bzr itself (poolie tackled a bunch of bugs), but this is different code doing the same kind of thing\n<mgz> so, we don't benefit from that.\n<mgz> I said to jelmer when I last looked at this that ideally the bzrtools_ copied modules would ideally just be ripped out and replaced\n<vila> ha\n<mgz> most of the logic isn't used, just the core transform, which should live elsewhere\n<mgz> (and then it would get its bugs and corner cases fixed more easily)\n<vila> just a matter of refactoring under the associated tests umbrella right ?\n<mgz> right.\n<mgz> there are six or so testcases for it\n<vila> better than I thought :-P\n<mgz> probably some more need writing or things would break, but the job is basically to work out what the code is trying to do and then make it use other mechanisms :)\n<mgz> at worst, it would highlight gaps in the bzrlib api that need plugging, and could then share testing but not implementation yet\n<mgz> ^good mgz classic double 'ideally' up there\n<mgz> vila: so, it was on my list for when I wanted to get to know transform code better, if you have a bunch of similar failures now it might be worth tackling before then\n<vila> I think I will file a bug and punt, I've got a good enough explanation for the failure and more important ones to address first :-/\n<mgz> :)\n<vila> I agree with the feeling that this code is duplicating features that should be implemented elsewhere but it's more a gut feeling that a real understanding\n<mgz> hm... transport.get_transport(something_bogus) doesn't raise these days?\n<mgz> connection doesn't happen till later?\n<vila> yup, always have\n<mgz> okay, ensure_base() should do, the commented out test just needs fixing\n<vila> even .has('not-exist') should be enough (and is already used as an idiom working for read-only transports too)\n<vila> bug #800270\n<ubot5> Launchpad bug 800270 in BzrTools \"import-tar incorrectly handles symlinks turned into directories\" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/800270\n<vila> mgz: by the way, since you reviewed the 2.4 variant, https://code.launchpad.net/~vila/bzr/test-server-races/+merge/84096 should be easy to review ;)\n<mgz> I have a tab in my browser for that :)\n<vila> You'll even find the comments you were asking for at the time but weren't committed when I submitted :-}\n<mgz> okay, fixed test works, just need to make a less hacky varient\n<vila> i.e. have a look at the revisions dates ;)\n<CaMason> quick Q... how can I get my working tree to be at a particular revision?\n<mgz> `bzr update -r N`\n<mgz> using revert works as well, and may be what you want depending on the circumstance\n<CaMason> ok thanks\n<mgz> what I sometimes do as well, if I want to jump between revisions and maybe base other work of them\n<mgz> is create a new (treeless) branch with `bzr branch -r N dev rN` and then switch my checkout to and from it\n<CaMason> I'm getting a bunch of conflict messages.

I am trying to branch emacs and it keeps stopping, then I have to start the whole thing over.

What do I win?\n<vila> mgz: rats, lunch of course\n<chromaticwt> why learn c++ before lisp?\n<vila> mgz: I'm still holding my breath\n<wgz> it will be very exciting... maybe\n<vila> hehe\n<fullermd> I dunno, I think holding your breath that long is probably pretty boring.\n<fullermd> Maybe not for your heirs, I guess.\n<vila> she looks worried indeed\n<lamalex> jml, is there a convenient way to call testtools.run from python on all of my test_ modules?\n<jml> lamalex: 'testtools.run discover [package]' iirc\n<jml> lamalex: http://testtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/for-test-authors.html#running-your-tests will get it righter than me :)\n<lamalex> jml, thats from a shell though\n<jml> lamalex: what are you trying to do?\n<jml> lamalex: or, is testtools.run.main() not convenient enough for you?\n<lamalex> jml, nevermind that discover thing was exactly what i needed\n<lamalex> jml, setUp runs for every test_ method, is there a TestCase wide set up?\n<jml> lamalex: no.\n<jml> lamalex: having such a thing is a bad idea\n<lamalex> why's that\n<jml> lamalex: because it makes test isolation very hard\n<jml> lamalex: which in turn makes it very easy to write tests where a failure or mistake in one corrupts the results of others\n<lamalex> jml, yah but we're not writing traditional unit tests\n<jml> lamalex: are you not interested in the results of these tests?\n<vila> wgz: encoding guessing... to cope with people using wrong fs encodings or not setting any ?\n<vila> (I had to breath .... ;)\n<wgz> not quite yet, but that one is on the list :)\n<vila> oooh, at least properly reporting the full string on unicode exceptions ?\n<wgz> yup, and full unicode output for all errors.\n * vila whistles\n * vila hugs mgz too\n<fullermd> Pah.  7 bits should be enough for anyone.\n<vila> now, given that nexuiz-data needs more than 24h and that we kill imports that exceed their 24h quota... we need a finer-grained configuration ;)\n<vila> jelmer: pretty cute failure: http://babune.ladeuil.net:24842/job/selftest-chroot-precise/lastFailedBuild/testReport/junit/bzrlib.tests.blackbox.test_checkout/TestSmartServerCheckout/test_lightweight_checkout/\n<vila> jelmer: looks like you did even better than you thought ;-D\n<jelmer> vila: argh\n<jelmer> vila: we'll have to change the lower limit to 34 I guess\n<vila> jelmer: yup, not a problem\n<jelmer> vila: there's a lot of variation in a single \"bzr co --lightweight\" command\n<vila> which is not ideal for a test but meh\n<vila> the point is to not go up\n<vila> do you really need the 9 commits ?\n<jelmer> vila: this is before I worked my magic btw ;-) the hpss-get-inventories branch brings it down to 15\n<vila> woohoo\n<vila> jelmer, mgz : would you mind clearing the active reviews page guys, you have 7 approved reviews ready to land there :)\n<wgz> I'm trying to get everything ready all at once :D\n<vila> hehe, beware of conflicts when landing... the more you land before hand the less conflicts you bump into ;)\n<vila> on top of that you have one for 2.4 that will need to be merged up ;-p\n<jelmer> hmm\n<jelmer> vila: I wonder if that RevisionNotPresent issue we've been hitting with the importer is related to the repository not clearing it's caching of negative revids in the parent map cache\n<jelmer> vila: it looks like the \"PoMerger created\" message made it into bzr.dev, btw\n<kirkland> okay, a couple of bzr fast-import questions, from git\n<kirkland> I've done the fast-export from git, and then fast-import into bzr\n<kirkland> I now have a directory of a bunch of branches/tags, I think\n<kirkland> I guess I'm trying to figure out what/how to do with those\n<jelmer> hi Dustin\n<jelmer> kirkland: You should be able to just use those branches like you normally would\n<jelmer> kirkland: if they don't have a working tree yet, you can use \"bzr co\" to create one\n<kirkland> jelmer: oh, hmm, okay\n<kirkland> jelmer: let me try those\n<kirkland> jelmer: all of them looked \"empty\" except for .bzr\n<kirkland> jelmer: i guess i just needed to co them\n<jelmer> kirkland: we should have bzr-fastimport hint that the branches created are tree-less, just like most other bzr import tools do\n<jelmer> kirkland: this is done for space reasons, btw - you don't want to end up with 20 copies of the kernel if you're fastimporting a kernel repo with 20 branches\n<vila> jelmer: I left it there on purpose, I still have doubts about whether it's created only once and it's the cheapest way to gather data. Once I get this feedback, I'll address the issue one way or the other (remove the message or fix the duplicated creation)\n<vila> jelmer: hence my reply to your review: \"It's not useless noise\" ;)\n<jelmer> vila: it should at least be hidden behind a debug flag in that case I think\n<jelmer> vila: it's showing up for every revision processed by the udd importer\n<vila> it's one line per merge and will be useless if hidden behind a debug flag...\n<Noldorin> what's the easiest way to run Bzr server as a Windows Service?\n<jelmer> vila: that's the case for lots of things\n<jelmer> vila: doesn't mean we have them enabled by default :_)\n<vila> then consider that I put a debug flag active by default and that this will be revisited\n<jelmer> vila: sure, I'll file a bug\n<vila> if you're really searching to reduce the size of the import logs, there are far bigger targets though\n<jelmer> vila: sure, I'm just saying it's noise unless you're actually trying to debug something related to pomerge\n<vila> I *am* :)\n<vila> I mentioned that I've seen at least one case where the message where there twice for the same merge\n<vila> but to avoid chasing ghosts for too long I submitted without digging further (nothing in my proposal should trigger such a behavior)\n<vila> and there is one spurious merge in this sentence\n<vila> ghaa, where not merge\n<vila> way past EOD ;)\n<jelmer> vila: I still don't think that's a good reason, by that reasoning we might as well enable a whole bunch of things because they will help with debugging - like -Dhpss and -Devil\n<jelmer> vila: if there was a -Dpo_merge flag, *you* could enable it\n<jelmer> anyway, it is indeed well past EOD :-)\n#bzr 2011-12-03\n<pcpratts> any ideas why my system can't find bzr-gtk?\n<pcpratts> I installed from the ppa, sudo apt-get install bzr-gtk\n<pcpratts> pcpratts@helloworld:~$ bzr-gtk\n<pcpratts> bzr-gtk: command not found\n<pcpratts> are there any tests I can do?\n<jelmer> pcpratts: bzr-gtk is a plugin for bzr, which provides extra subcommands to bzr\n<jelmer> e.g. \"bzr viz\"\n<pcpratts> jelmer: okay thanks!\n<pcpratts> I have used git and hg\n<pcpratts> learning to use bzr so I can push a .deb package to a ppa\n<pcpratts> have to do something fun on a friday night\n<pcpratts> jelmer: do you know of somewhere I can find the available bzr-gtk commands?\n<pcpratts> ah, I found it.  bzr help gtk\n#bzr 2011-12-04\n<Noldorin_> any windows guys around here?\n<jelmer> hi Noldorin_\n<fullermd> I hope so.

But it's like \"laughed a good laugh\"; doesn't mean you're laughing AT a good laugh, just laughing in a good way.\n<fullermd> Thus, I'd be laughing in a scadenfreudorific fashion.\n<Noldorin_> fullermd, oh right, i slightly misread your original message\n<Noldorin_> yeah.,\n<Noldorin_> fair enough\n<Noldorin_> fullermd, still, lol @ \"schadenfrude\"\n<fullermd> (yes, language _is_ my plaything, why do you ask?  ;)\n<Noldorin_> i don't ask ;-)\n<Noldorin_> but i do admire the rare software developer who has a good grasp of natural language in addition to those of the programming variety.\n<fullermd> Well, I'm a perl guy, not a python nut.  Twisting things into valid but bizarrely hideous constructs is second nature.\n<fullermd> Maybe first and a halfth nature.\n<Noldorin_> heh\n<Noldorin_> thou speaketh not with forked tongue.\n<fullermd> Depends on what I'm working on.  Sometimes, my language _does_ get pretty forked.\n<Noldorin_> fullermd, especially if it's process-related bash ;-)\n<fullermd> Oh, I'd be all KINDS of forked off if my processes started showing up under bash...\n * fullermd hugs his precious %\n<Noldorin_> meh, powershell is what the cool kids use these days.\n<fullermd> I...   you...   it doesn't...   the world...

But it's uncouth to even try.\n<fullermd> It's unsporting to engage in a battle of wits with an unarmed man.\n<Noldorin_> oh trust me, if i wanted to face an unarmed man, i'd pick on Apple users.\n<Noldorin_> i daresay there's 100s of delightfully trollable users online Freenode right now!\n<Noldorin_> *sits here typing this on his MacBook Pro*\n<fullermd> If you unsuccessfully troll yourself, is that victory or defeat?\n<Noldorin_> it's some strange superposition of the two\n<Noldorin_> Schrodinger called it win-lose.\n<Noldorin_> it has adverse affects on the fabric of quantum space-time.\n<fullermd> Ah yes, Quantum Trollodynamics.  Much harder to evaluate than the old Substandard Model.\n<Noldorin_> i can't decide whether that's the study of the motion of tiny trolls, or the study of the effects of a little bit of trolling\n<fullermd> Well, it means when you get into sufficiently small quantities of trolling, it becomes impossible to tell which side is being trolled.  Only on the macro-level do things settle down.\n<Noldorin_> yeah. it's what makes uber-trolls so deterministic.\n<Noldorin_> predictable, that is.\n<Noldorin_> i'm still waiting for the 10^-50 chance some uber-troll spontaneously trolls himself.\n<fullermd> These sort of things have a built in uncertainty principle, too.  It's impossible to discuss them at all without driving any real physicists in the audience into a seething rage over pop-cultural interpretations of their field...\n<Noldorin_> it's the only reason i'm on IRC, you now\n<Noldorin_> know*\n<Noldorin_> research into QTD.\n<lifeless> quantum troll displacement?\n<Noldorin_> quantum trollodynamics\n<Noldorin_> but indeed, displacement is an interesting phenomenon too\n<Noldorin_> i hear there's a net out-flux from EFnet these days\n<fullermd> That's just Cherangstkov radiation.\n<Noldorin_> fullermd, funnily enough, i am a \"physicist\", and as such can vouch that our humour is pretty much confined to this level\n<Noldorin_> in the same way the quark-gluon palsma is confined to the atomic nucleus.\n<fullermd> Only until we turn up the Electron Pump.\n<Noldorin_> don't meddle with such things\n<Noldorin_> the results are unknowable!\n<fullermd> Oh sure, _that_ advice always has the desired effect   :p\n<fullermd> You say \"meddle\", I say \"hold my beer and watch this!\"\n<Noldorin_> irony is interpreted literally by physicists, alas\n<fullermd> So I Fe.\n<Noldorin_> you iron?\n<Noldorin_> ppft.\n<fullermd> Sometimes iron, sometimes youron.\n<fullermd> I don't know.

One moment.\n<Logan_> Alright, thanks. :)\n<Logan_> I'm requesting it based on http://package-import.ubuntu.com/status/ and the linked https://bugs.launchpad.net/udd/+bug/714622 , which recommends running that command for packages that encounter that bzr failure. It has worked in the past.\n<ubot5> Ubuntu bug 714622 in Ubuntu Distributed Development \"import fails when lp branch has been push --overwrite'n\" [High,Confirmed]\n<jam> Logan_: I have requeued your package.\n<Logan_> Awesome, thanks jam. :)\n<gour> morning\n<gour> i've a need to use svn to contribute to some open-source project, so wonder how does bzr-svn compare with hg & git's options?\n<gour> otoh, it's sad to see bzr development stalled :-(\n<lifeless> bzr-svn is pretty good\n<mgz> mornin'\n<jam> morning mgz\n<gour> lifeless: what's going  to happen with bzr?\n<mathrick> hiya\n<mathrick> so what exactly is the difference between development-colo and bzr-colo, and how am I supposed to use the former?\n<jiku> hello All..\n<jiku> im pretty new to bazaar and would like to implement it in my workplace..\n<jiku> bzr-explorer is good and would like to master it so that i can talk to developers on how to use it and create a workflow.\n<jiku> 1 issue im facing is..\n<jiku> i have a revision in the server with name, think-blog..\n<jiku> i checkout in a client (win7) machine with bzr-explorer installed.\n<jiku> it asks for sftp password when doing checkout which is normal.\n<jiku> once i download, if im not wrong, the revision with its history is saved in the client..\n<jiku> but here whenever i open bazaar explorer and open that working tree, it asks for passwords.. when i do a diff, it asks for passwrods..\n<jiku> why is it still dependent on the server which actually should be doing everything from the local perspective ?\n<jiku> any ideas ?\n<jiku> or is it that im doing it wrong ?\n<jiku> hi,.. anybody ?\n<mgz> jiku: you don't want a lightweight checkout, you want to make a proper branch\n<jiku> mgz, oh.. ok...\n<jiku> i was doing that by default..\n<jiku> let me try again.\n<mgz> you then also may want to put the passwords in your authentications.conf file, see `bzr help authentication`\n<jiku> ok..\n<jiku> let me try this..\n<mgz> or, use an agent so you don't type the password each time but use a public key instea\n<mgz> d\n<mgz> mathrick: you don't want to use development-colo, but you can use the builtin colo support in 2.6, it's just a little less polished than the bzr-colo plugin\n<jiku> mgz, hmm..\n<jiku> looks like, whenever i do a checkout using explorer, it does  with --lightweight enabled.\n<mgz> you don't want to do checkout\n<mgz> you want a branch\n<mgz> (I suspect)\n<mgz> if you have options over workflows, you really don't want to emulate the centralised server thing of svn etc\n<jiku> mgz, true.. yes..\n<jiku> mgz, was confused with git (never used but just read).. there you checkout and branch.. (if im not wrong)\n<mgz> depends what you think you can get everyone else to use, but having a full branch locally, and working with trunk+merge is how to get the main benefit of dvcs\n<jiku> yes.. right.. this is what we need actually.. there shouldn't be a centralized locking..\n<mgz> in git, saying 'checkout' means get me all the history, and branch just... prints the branch name or something\n<mathrick> mgz: right, but still, how do I use it? I don't see much explaining how to do it\n<mgz> mathrick: basically, you just create a new standalone branch, do `bzr switch -b trunk` or whatever to name the default branch\n<mathrick> ah\n<mgz> then you can do `bzr switch -b feature` to create a feature branch\n<mgz> `bzr switch trunk` to go back to trunk\n<mathrick> and what about cloning, will it carry over all branches?\n<mgz> the main missing thing is a nice addressing scheme for colocated branches outside of a few commands\n<mathrick> I see an open bug about it, so I guess not?\n<mgz> right, it doesn't, though there's a workaround of some kind I think\n<mathrick> what'd that be?\n<mgz> not sure, but it's reasonably trivial to iterate over local branches and push them all up, there's a plugin that does something like that for shared repos\n<mathrick> this was what I hoped most for, along with fixing the fact that bzr-colo refers to branches with absolute paths, which breaks alternative approaches of just sharing the same workspace dir amongst many machines\n<mathrick> mgz: well, yes, but it needs thinking on my part and remembering to do it. As much as I think git's model is stupid, the fact that fetch carries over everything is a boon\n<mathrick> not just my part, but everyone I talk to\n<mathrick> which is a bigger problem really\n<mathrick> mgz: does 2.6 need anything in the way of the branch format to support colocated branches?\n<mgz> nope, that's all done\n<mathrick> so just 2a?\n<mgz> it's just making it all pretty to use that's unfinished\n<mathrick> mhm\n<mgz> I'm using it for one project currently as an experiment\n<mgz> apart from some confusion setting up, and needing to know to type file:,branch=FEATURE in a few circumstances, I've not had any issues\n<mgz> that said, I've not wanted to push all branches, push has been specifically for updating remote trunk after feature branch merge\n<Logan_> jam: Can you please do < requeue_package.py --full iscsitarget > when you get the chance? Thanks so much!\n<Logan_> (Or any other UDDer, for that matter.)\n<mgz> warum?\n<mgz> I can do this... well, I could look at the package log as well, but would prefer to not take 15 minutes looking at it first.\n<nDuff> Is shelve expected to work with bzr-svn? I'm getting \"NotImplementedError: <bound method SvnBasisTree.path_content_summary of <SvnBasisTree for '<SvnWorkingTree of /home/cduffy/VC/boundsetter>'>>\"\n<jelmer> nDuff: no, I don't think it works with bzr-svn\n#bzr 2012-11-27\n<lduros> Hi there, what's the proper way to resolve a content conflict when you have a directory and you have a directory from the tree you're merging but you really don't want that directory to be there? I tried bzr rm [directory], but then when I do bzr resolve, it doesn't seem to list it as resolved\n<lduros> I guess after rm -rf the directory, if I do bzr resolve --all. it takes care of it\n<didrocks> hey\n<didrocks> I have a branch which is in split mode (well, I guess seeing my change to .bzr-builddeb/default.conf)\n<didrocks> but when I bzr bd, I see: Building package in native mode\n<didrocks> and then:\n<didrocks> This package has a Debian revision number but there does not seem to be\n<didrocks> an appropriate original tar file or .orig directory in the parent directory;\n<didrocks> \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n<didrocks> any idea what can happen? Forcing split mode with --split in bzr bd, it works fine\n<jelmer> didrocks: debian/source/format perhaps?\n<didrocks> jelmer: it's set to 3.0 (quilt), does it impact it? it's run before bzr split it?\n<didrocks> oh\n<didrocks> yeah, it's native, not split\n<didrocks> thanks jelmer :)\n#bzr 2012-11-28\n<AfC> I just did my first Pull Request on GitHub.\n<AfC> I feel dirty.\n<fullermd> Did you wear gloves?\n<gmarkall> sometimes when i try to rebase, bzr identifies almost an entire file being in conflict when only a small portion has changed - does that sound like I'm doing something wrong?\n<AfC> In bzr land, using rebase is doing it wrong, but anyway.\n<gmarkall> i've just noted that if i try a merge instead, it seems to pick out the lines that have actually changed\n<gmarkall> AfC: can I quote you on that?\n<gmarkall> (i'm not a fan of rebasing with bzr at all! :-) )\n<AfC> gmarkall: sure\n<AfC> gmarkall: Bazaar takes a much stronger view of merging, and doesn't encourage people to throw history away. Some Git communities think that merging (by anyone other than the maintainer) is bad, so rebase.\n<AfC> gmarkall: my impression is that GitHub has effectively made it such that people don't have to think about this anymore, but we'll see\n<LeoNerd> I hardly ever rebase in bzr\n<LeoNerd> The only time I do it is when I accidentally diverged history on a branch, say, between my laptop and my server by not being up-to-date first before committing locally on the laptop\n<mgz> I cherrypick specific changes from time to time, which is pretty much the same thing\n<mgz> but easier to do safely as you have two branches at all points\n<gmarkall> AfC: thanks. when you say \"people don't have to think about this anymore\", are you referring to the fact that you can just click a button to merge a pull request as long as its rebased on the branch being merged into?\n<gmarkall> or do you mean that people are rebasing without thinking?\n<AfC> gmarkall: no, that it's provinding better UI around commit selection and selectively viewing history\n<AfC> gmarkall: meaning you don't have to rebase\n<gmarkall> ah, right\n<gmarkall> so anyway, if a project is using bzr and wants clean history (hence the rebasing), it's acceptable to say \"you're not using a good strategy, could you please start using merging instead of rebasing?\"\n<gmarkall> since i'm relatively inexperienced with bzr, i'd be nervous about telling people how to use it without being sure of what i'm saying\n<LarstiQ_> gmarkall: hmmm, telling others how to work is perhaps not the way to go\n<fullermd> Not?  Well, what's the fun in THAT?\n * LarstiQ_ stresses the perhaps\n<gmarkall> it does seem rather brazen\n * LarstiQ_ isn't sure what to suggest\n<LarstiQ_> gmarkall: how attached are they to this workflow?\n<LarstiQ_> gmarkall: rebasing can be useful, but there are reasons not to do it all the time. Perhaps dig up a post by Linus where he complains about this.\n<LarstiQ_> gmarkall: I guess I don't understand this desire for a \"clean history\" over real history\n * LarstiQ_ back to math\n<fullermd> Hey, you eliminate terms in math.  That's just like making a clean history   ;p\n<gokr> I know its a bit silly to enter and ask this question but I do have quite a bit of experience of SCMs but can't really find a proper \"modern\" comparison of bzr and hg. If anyone can share their view on why bzr is preferrable I am interested.\n<gokr> I have used git, SVN, CVS, darcs and even hg a bit a few years back. Only dabbled with bzr but now I am contemplating giving it a more serious try.\n<wilx> Hi.\n<wilx> What does 'bzr rmbranch' do exactly?\n<wilx> What if I just do 'rm -rf foo' on the branch checkout and directory inside my shared tree?\n<wilx> What is the difference?\n<jelmer> wilx: rmbranch removes the branch, not the tree or the control directory\n<wilx> Hmm, like in the shared repository's metadata?\n<jelmer> wilx: in older style bzr branches it basically removes .bzr/branch\n<wilx> Or to put it another way around: Can I safely do 'rm -rf foo work-foo' to remove the temporary foo branch from my shared repo?\n<wilx> Ah.\n<jelmer> wilx: yes\n<wilx> Cool, thank you.\n#bzr 2012-11-29\n<mgz> morning!\n<jelmer> hey mgz!\n<mgz> hey!\n<vila> hey jelmer, mgz ;)\n<jelmer> hi vila\n<jlf> hi #bzr, i'm getting the error 'bzr: ERROR: Unable to connect to target of bound branch BzrBranch7(file:///Users/jlf/trunk/) => bzr+ssh://jlf@bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/trunk/: Not a branch: \"bzr+ssh://jlf@bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/trunk/\".' when i try to do  bzr up  -- this may be due to firewall settings beyond my control.  can i specify an alternate transport method to update my repo?\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: that depends on what savannah is providing\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: but, maybe that is not the problem\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: can you verify some other way /emacs/trunk exists and is a bzr branch?\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: hitchhiker might be helpful\n<jlf> i've used this in the past without incident, but i suspect the firewall is blocking me from this location\n<LarstiQ_> aha, then the error is a bit misleading\n<jlf> it wouldn't be the first time :)\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: other transports are slower, but you could see if http or sftp works (though if ssh works, sftp probably doesn't either)\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: myself I'd maybe try tunneling ssh through somewhere else\n<jlf> i'm something of a noob -- how can i check and specify the transport method?  iow i can set up a tunnel but i don't know how to tell bzr to go there instead of savannah:22\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: if savannah provides the bzr:// protocol you can also try that\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: let's see\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: either a Host entry in ~/.ssh/config, since bzr calls out to ssh anyway, or\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: bzr+ssh://host:port/path\n<jlf> LarstiQ_: thanks.  since i don't see an option to specify transport in  bzr up  , how should i specify it?\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: that sounds like you're using a checkout\n<jlf> i'm an extremely casual user but i have pushed a few changes into the tree successfully this way\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: you can use `bzr bind bzr+ssh://host:port` to bind your checkout to something else\n<jlf> great, thank you!\n<LarstiQ_> jlf: remember to change it back when the firewall is no longer an obstacle :)\n * jlf nods\n<fullermd> Doing manual ssh/sftp-ery is a good way to see if you can't track down where things break.\n#bzr 2012-11-30\n<delinquentme> someone removed my .rvmrc file from the repo ... once upon a time it was mainted in the repo\n<delinquentme> is there a way to restore the version in a given revno?\n<mgz> morning\n<ccxCZ> is there a tool to visualise the branching of several branches with same root?\n<ccxCZ> launchpad has something like that on project pages iirc\n<mgz> you can run qlog in a shared repo and get multi-branch history, probably not quite what you want but can be handy\n<ccxCZ> that's for only one branch though?\n<ccxCZ> how would I go about traversing everything in a shared repository and creating a graphviz diagram for it? http://people.canonical.com/~mwh/bzrlibapi/bzrlib.repository.Repository.html#all_revision_ids returns an iterator over a http://people.canonical.com/~mwh/bzrlibapi/bzrlib.revision.html I assume...\n<mgz> ccxCZ: see the bzr branches command for reference, bzrlib/builtins.py cmd_branches\n<ccxCZ> hmm, so far it seems simpler to postprocess the output of log --long --with-ids with awk instead of doing it using bzrlib\n<LarstiQ> ccxCZ: qlog can do multiple branches, `bzr qlog ~/branch1 ~/branch2` is an example from its help\n<ccxCZ> neat, thanks\n<lduros> hi, I'm doing bzr export new-folder mybranch and it's a pretty big directory, on which I run ./configure && make -- then when I make change to my branch, is there a way to update the exported folder without rewriting all the files there?\n<mgz> lduros: not sure, I'll note that bzr-upload does smarter sync, but if it's just for a local build dir that's probably not what you want\n<lduros> hmm, right yeh\n<lduros> mgz: I guess the easiest thing to do is to just copy those files manually\n<lduros> :-)\n<mgz> any particular reason you're not just using a lightweight checkout and using update say?\n<lduros> mgz: no, no reason, didn't think about it\n<lduros> mgz: i'm still learning bzr really\n<lduros> I'm trying to figure out what you mean by a lightweight checkout ;-)\n<mgz> well, some things match particular ways of doing stuff better, it's always a bit hard to see without trying and seeing what hurts :)\n<lduros> no local branch or repo\n<lduros> ok\n<lduros> hehe\n<nDuff> lduros: *nod* -- lightweight checkouts are more like the traditional svn way of doing things\n<mgz> so, `bzr checkout --lightweight mybranch new-folder`\n<lduros> mgz: so I just do this: bzr checkout mybranch mylightweightco?\n<lduros> ah ok\n<lduros> nice :-)\n<lduros> alright, that should same me some time on the build :-)\n<mgz> as it's a real versioned thing linked to the branch, it can do more, but also possible to get in a bit of a muddle, provided you remember you can just ignore stuff in there if it's a scratch build folder you should be fine\n<lduros> right, ok :-)\n<lduros> mgz: thanks much for the lesson!\n<mgz> what I often do for build-intensive projects where I actually want to use feature branches is have a --no-trees repo with all the branches under it, then a 'tree' lightweight checkout I work in and switch between the branches, and other checkouts on demand\n<lduros> hmm, sounds like the way to go!\n<lduros> mgz: so once I have made changes to my branch, how do I bring them in my lightweight checkout. if I do bzr merge ../mybranch, it tells me the working tree has uncommitted changes\n<lduros> bzr update?\n<lduros> yeh looks like it\n<lduros> cool!\n<lduros> :-)\n<mgz> that's the one :)\n#bzr 2013-11-25\n<amitprakash> Hi, how do I get the code from a directory in a bzr repository? specifically.. how do I get the code here http://bzr.mozilla.org/bmo/4.2/files\n<lifeless> amitprakash: bzr branch http://bzr.mozilla.org/bmo/4.2 I imagine\n<LeoNerd> So... It turns out that bzr over a 3-hop ProxyCommand sshfs is a liiiitttle bit slow\n<LeoNerd> Like... orders of magnitude slower than just filesystem access on the disk\n<fullermd> That's 'cuz 3 is a prime number.

Is it an actual uncommit or a simulation by applying a reverse diff?\n<Peng_> Actual uncommit. (And it doesn't remove the commit from the repository.)\n<Peng_> (It removes it from the branch, but not the repository's underlying storage.)\n<Zectbumo> ah, so logs are still present but no diff/undiff\n<Zectbumo> or are you saying the repository does diff then undiff and the branch gets stripped?\n<Peng_> Neither?\n<Zectbumo> like for instance if a password was checked in and then uncommitted. would the password data exist somewhere?\n<Peng_> Yes.\n<Zectbumo> okay\n<Peng_> Yes./32\n<Peng_> Oops\n<Zectbumo> thx guys\n<Zectbumo> btw, bzr is my favorite and I don't want to move from it and it seems to me that it's not gaining popularity and that scares me\n<Zectbumo> One sign I found was Trac and Bzr not working as well anymore and it appeared that nobody was interested in fixing the incompatibilities in the tracbzr plugin for quite some time.

Ich bin noch recht unerfahren mit ubuntu und habe ein Problem beim Kopieren von Musik auf meinen ipod nano (3. generation). Habe mir daf\u00c3\u00bcr das Programm \"gtkpod\" runtergeladen und Musik drauf kopiert. Allerdings wird mir nur ein Bruchteil der Musik im iPod angezeigt. Es wird aber trotzdem angezeigt, dass Speicher belegt ist. Jemand ne Ahnung woran das liegen kann?\n<bullgard4_> anditouzani: Welche UbuntuVersion?\n<anditouzani> bullgard4: 10.04\n<bullgard4_> anditouzani: ich habe mal ein bi\u00c3\u009fchen gegoogelt. Mit der Unterst\u00c3\u00bctzung von iPod 3. Generation scheint es noch nicht gut auszusehen. --  Vielleicht probierst Du mal Banshee oder Rhythmbox bei einem Freund aus, der eine neuere Ubuntu-Version hat als Du.\n<jokrebel> anditouzani: Die Wiki-Seite dazu kennst Du bereits? http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Ipod/gtkpod\n<anditouzani> jokrebel: ja danke kenn ich. \n<anditouzani> bullgard: werden die beiden programme nicht unter 10.04 unterst\u00c3\u00bctzt? \n<bullgard4_> anditouzani: Doch. Aber sie unterst\u00c3\u00bctzen vielleicht iPod 3. Generation besser in den beiden neueren Ubuntu-Versionen. (Das geht nicht klar hervor aus dem, was ich ergoogelt habe.)\n<jokrebel> anditouzani: Da Dein IPod nicht mit Linux l\u00c3\u00a4uft, wirst Du Dich ggf. bei Apple beschweren m\u00c3\u00bcssen.\n<anditouzani> alles klar, danke euch beiden! \n<phoenix123> Hi kann mir jmd helfen???\n<jokrebel> phoenix123: Ohne konkrete Frage? Nein!\n<jokrebel> phoenix123: Ohne konkrete Frage? Nein!\n<phoenix123> also ich m\u00c3\u00b6chte die schriftfarbe vom bootscreen \u00c3\u00a4ndern (nicht die ok`s)... weis aber nicht wie...\n<jokrebel> phoenix123: Bootscreen? Grub? http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB\n<jokrebel> ...oder auch Grub_2\n<phoenix123> ja\n<phoenix123> (?)\n<dAnjou> oh man ey, manche kommen hier mit kernel panics, andere mit versehentlich gel\u00c3\u00b6schten usb-sticks an ... und er will ne schriftfarbe \u00c3\u00a4ndern -.-\n<jokrebel> dAnjou: Wer keine Probleme hat versucht sich halt an Sch\u00c3\u00b6nheitskorrekturen - aber das ist wohl OT.\n<hermes>  gel\u00c3\u00b6schten usb-sticks<LOL\n<hermes> oh man xchat spinnt\n<phoenix123> wd\n<jokrebel> hermes: Dann richte es bitte\n<phoenix123> ich war das... sry ka warum er immer closed...?\n<dreamon> ring1, Bios ist bereit.. ;)\n<phoenix123> jokrebel: hast du eine idee wie ich das hibekomme???\n<phoenix123> ???\n<jokrebel> phoenix123: Inder zugeh\u00c3\u00b6rigen Wiki \u00c3\u00bcber Grub/Grub2 suchen vielleicht? Mich selbst haben die Standardeinstellungen des Bootsplash noch nicht wirklich interessiert.\n<phoenix123> ja ubuntuuser-wiki habe ich geschaut aber da kann man iwie nur die ok`s mache.... deshalb hab ich ja mal hier reingeschaut :)\n<dAnjou> phoenix123: lass es doch einfach. den bootscreen siehst du wie lange? 2-3 sekunden?\n<phoenix123> ja aber ich m\u00c3\u00b6chte es unbedingt... ist halt nicht f\u00c3\u00bcr mich usw....\n<jokrebel> phoenix123: Dann wirst Du Dich gedulden m\u00c3\u00bcssen, ob vielleicht jemand anderes eine Idee hat. Optische Probleme beim Booten (solange es Funktioniert) haben IMHO Priorit\u00c3\u00a4t 17\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n<dAnjou> jokrebel: aber nur wenn erstrangige probleme bei -100 anfangen\n<phoenix123> :(\n<sdx23> zumal die Wiki-Seite reicht, wenn man etwas mitdenkt und das Skript etwas liest, wird man darauf kommen, an welchen Stellen man das einf\u00c3\u00bcgen muss. Allerdings sei gewarnt darin rumzupfuschen, wenn man keine Ahnung hat; das macht im Zweifelsfalle ehr was kaputt...\n<jokrebel> phoenix123: Und Du hast immer noch nicht einmal erz\u00c3\u00a4hlt ob Du Grub oder Grub2 nutzt.\n<phoenix123> na ich denke grub2 wegen 10.10....\n<dAnjou> sdx23: btw. es sind xml-dateien (ganz konkret tomboy-notizen) und es gibt xmldiff :D\n<dAnjou> just FYI\n<jokrebel> phoenix123: na dann http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB_2 ... good luck\n<sdx23> dAnjou: ah, ic.\n<phoenix123> bb\n<LindseyDonald_> hey, wo installiert man eigentlich programme hin, die man nicht \u00c3\u00bcber den paket-manager bezieht? Der Installer schl\u00c3\u00a4gt mir hier /home/mein-profil/QtSDK vor, jedoch nutzen den computer 2 leute und ich m\u00c3\u00b6chte das SDK nicht nur f\u00c3\u00bcr mich installieren, oder ist es sinnvoller es in mein home-folder zu installieren?\n<sdx23> LindseyDonald_: /opt\n<jokrebel> LindseyDonald_: Etwas an der Paketverwatung vorbei zu installieren ist generell keine gute Idee.\n<sdx23> und die Binaries, die man aufrufen k\u00c3\u00b6nnen m\u00c3\u00b6chte symlinken nach /usr/local/bin/\n<LindseyDonald_> sdx23, soll ich die berechtigungen von /opt anpassen oder einen unterordern programs erstellen, da mein user ja keine rechte hat, oder ich installiere mit sudo\n<sdx23> bzw. wenn man configure/make/makeinstall nimmt, einen Blick auf checkinstall werfen.\n<LindseyDonald_> jokrebel, sdx23, es handelt sich um das QtSDK wo halt alles dabei ist und ich mehere Qt versionen installieren (was wichtig f\u00c3\u00bcr mich ist)\n<LindseyDonald_> sdx23, sind keine sourcen, ist ein richtiger installer \n<sdx23> Ja, wenn der sich auf ein Verzeichnis beschr\u00c3\u00a4nkt, dann leg das als root nach /opt/QtSDK\n<sdx23> es gibt aber auch: http://packages.ubuntu.com/de/lucid/qt-sdk\n<jokrebel> LindseyDonald_: Wenn Du fremde Sachen benutzt kann/k\u00c3\u00b6nnen viele hier bei Problemen nicht mehr weiterhelfen. Hast Du wirklich alles gecheckt, ob es nicht auch eine \"Ubuntu-L\u00c3\u00b6sung\" f\u00c3\u00bcr das gibt was auch immer Du erreichen willst?\n<LindseyDonald_> jokrebel, der zeit habe ich alle pakete via apt einzeln installiert (keine probleme) jedoch brauche ich mehere qt versionen damit ich diese auch testen kann um \u00c3\u00a4ltere versionen und neuere zu supporten\n<LindseyDonald_> sdx23, das sieht gut aus mal gucken ob es das selbe ist was ich bei nokia runter laden kann\n<Pilatus> gibt es eine M\u00c3\u00b6glichkeit die Auslastung der CPU zu loggen und in einem Terminal abzufragen ?\n<bekks> Ja, \"top\" angucken.\n<cartun> nabend\n<cartun> kann man mich lesen?\n<jokrebel> cartun: n\u00c3\u00b6 <grins>\n<cartun> :P\n<cartun> ok\n<cartun> ich bin sehr altmodisch und komme aus der debian ecke....\n<cartun> doch ich suche nun nach einen os das auch multimedia-technisch fit ist... also ist meine wahl auf ubuntu gefallen\n<cartun> doch eine frage, warum gibt es keinen root-account? ich bin es halt gewohnt...\n<pAt_> cartun: lmde\n<pAt_> cartun: sudo passwd\n<cartun> ja\n<cartun> aber warum ist es deaktiviert?\n<cartun> es ist ja ein doppeltes sicherheitsriko!?\n<jokrebel> cartun: Weil das mit Sudo unn\u00c3\u00b6tig ist. Genauere Erkl\u00c3\u00a4rungen findest Du im Wiki.\n<cartun> ja, aber es schr\u00c3\u00a4nkt doch die sicherheit ein oder nicht?\n<bekks> Und welches Sicherheitsrisiko ein deaktiviertes Passwort haben soll, das erkl\u00c3\u00a4re uns bitte im OT.\n<bekks> ,ot? cartun \n<shetlandpony> cartun: Dies ist ein Supportchannel!

Ich versuche mich (wie auf allen Unix-System) als Administrator anzumelden um Systemnahe aufgaben zu erledigen. Warum gibt es kein root-account sondern nur sudo?\n<bekks> Es gibt einen root account.\n<cartun> doch\n<bekks> grep root /etc/shadow sagt das sehr eindeutig.\n<cartun> lol, aber warum nicht? ich frage nicht ob es sinn macht oder nicht sondern nur warum es keinen root-account gibt\n<bekks> Es GIBT einen root Account.\n<bekks> grep root /etc/shadow sagt das sehr eindeutig.\n<cartun> okay, wie richte ich das ein?\n<cartun> normal wird es bei der einrichtung gefragt\n<bekks> Nein.\n<cartun> bei debian schon\n<KojiroAK> Ich sch\u00c3\u00a4tze mal, es gibt keinen exchange f\u00c3\u00a4higen MUA f\u00c3\u00bcr Linux?\n<bekks> Debian ist aber nicht Ubuntu.\n<cartun> ja ist klar\n<bekks> 0803 220655 < pAt_> cartun: sudo passwd\n<cartun> ...\n<jokrebel> cartun: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/sudo da ist das glaub ich erkl\u00c3\u00a4rt.

Lie\u00c3\u009f die den SUDO-Artikel durch und versuche zu verstehen.\n<KojiroAK> Ach so, dann kriege ich halt Arbeitsmails nur aufs Smarti.\n<KojiroAK> danke bekks \n<cartun> jokrebel, okay... ist halt sehr ungewohnt fuer mich ;)\n<cartun> ubuntu hat mehr als seine vorzuege.... nur das ein oder andere muss man halt nachlesen ;)\n<cartun> so bye und danke \n<jokrebel> cartun: Kein Problem. War es f\u00c3\u00bcr mich anfangs auch. Aber wenn man sich nicht mit dem allseits bekanntem (Admin)Namen \"root\" einloggen kann ist das IMHO schon alleine eine Sicherheitsrisiko-Minimierung.

Ein und desselben Subnetzes.\n<joe3> also kann ich damit daten aus dem netz eth0 ins netz eth1 schicken?\n<RedNifre> Bedeutet das jetzt, dass Ubuntu nicht bootet, wenn der WLAN-Empfang niedrig ist oder was?\n<RedNifre> Ich probiere nochmal den Computer auf die andere Seite unter den Schreibtisch zu stellen...\n<sdx23> joe3: wenn es dasselbe Netz ist, ja.

Unterschied ist jetzt, dass er freie Sicht auf die Zimmert\u00c3\u00bcr hat, anstatt dass das Sofa im Weg steht.\n<RedNifre> Naja, mir soll's recht sein, Problem gel\u00c3\u00b6st. :)\n<joe3> bekks das war jetzt nur als beispiel gedacht, alternativ: wenn die anderen computer an den beiden nics die selben IP adressbereiche haben\n<RedNifre> Das war's dann auch schon, macht's gut!\n<bekks> joe3: Ein v\u00c3\u00b6llig unbrauchbares Beispiel. :) Wie sdx23 schon sagte - wenn es das selbe Netz ist ja, wenn nicht dann nicht.\n<joe3> ich seh schon, das dauert a bissl bis ich da ganz dahintersteige, wenn ich jetzt einen dhcp server an NIC eth0 angschlossen habe, kann der dann IPs an Rechner vergeben, die an eth1 angeschlossen sind? DHCP->eth0->br0->eth1->anderePCs\n<bekks> Nur wenn Du einen DHCP-Relay konfigurierst.\n<bekks> Eine Bridge ist kein Hub.\n<joe3> mhm, auch wenn ich mir was anderes erhofft hab, holft mir das schon mal weiter\n<icedwater> Hallo!

Nun kannst Du noch suchen, ob es ein Ubuntu-PPA daf\u00c3\u00bcr gibt. Wenn nicht, ob es \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt ein PPA daf\u00c3\u00bcr gibt.

Ich habe in keiner locale \"es\" stehen.\n<ben1u> ich frage mich wieso fasst find das nicht am Ende der Suche zusammen?\n<ben1u> also von alleine, ohne die \u00c3\u009cbergabe an wc\n<ben1u> f\u00c3\u00bcr mich w\u00c3\u00a4re das ein logisches Feature\n<LetoThe2nd> ben1u: warum sollte es? unix-logik ist: ein tool, eine funktion. und \"finden\" hat mit \"z\u00c3\u00a4hlen\" halt mal nix zu tun\n<ben1u> okay, gibt es dann ein anderes tool, welches das kann?\n<LetoThe2nd> ben1u: f\u00c3\u00bcr \"z\u00c3\u00a4hlen\" gibts ein eigenes tool. und der unterschied zwischen leuten die's verstanden haben ist dass sie die unix-tools entsprechend kombinieren k\u00c3\u00b6nnen, anstatt nach replizierten features in allen m\u00c3\u00b6glichen formen zu schreien.\n<LetoThe2nd> ben1u: wenn du all-in-one haben willst, schreib dir halt einen zwei-zeilen-shellwrapper.\n<ben1u> naja man h\u00c3\u00a4tte es dennoch als Option einbauen k\u00c3\u00b6nnen\n<LetoThe2nd> ben1u: [x] du hast es nicht verstanden.\n<ben1u> doch habe ich :)\n<LetoThe2nd> ben1u: nein. wenn du \"z\u00c3\u00a4hlen\" einmal in find einbaust und einmal in wc, dann hast du replizierten code. schlecht zu warten. macht man nicht.\n<LetoThe2nd> ben1u: die unix-philosophie ist schon in sich stimmig. und \"man k\u00c3\u00b6nnte doch einmal, nur da..\" widerspricht der sache halt.\n<ben1u> na gut :-)\n<bullgard6> Wieso hat Ubuntu 12.04 die zwei Dateien /usr/bin/update-alternatives und /usr/sbin/update-alternatives installiert? Wie unterscheidet sich ihre Funktion? \n<LetoThe2nd> bullgard6: \"ls -al /usr/sbin/update-alternatives\"\n<bullgard6>  /usr/sbin/update-alternatives ist ein Symlink auf  /bin/update-alternatives. Wer oder was ben\u00c3\u00b6tigt /usr/sbin/update-alternatives?\n<geser> bullgard6: update-alternatives war mal in /usr/sbin und ist dann nach /usr/bin umgezogen (ungef\u00c3\u00a4hr 2009), damit alles noch weiterhin funktioniert wurde ein Symlink zur Kompatibilit\u00c3\u00a4t angelegt bis alle Paket-Skripte angepasst wurden\n<ben1u> huhu, kann mir jemand sagen ob man eine Dateisystem-Blockgr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fe von 64 oder 4096 nutzen sollte f\u00c3\u00bcr EncFS?\n<ben1u> unter 1024c habe ich 8254 Dateien und zwischen 1024c und 4096c habe ich 5316 Dateien.\n<ben1u> und \u00c3\u00bcber 4096c habe ich fast 18.000 Dateien\n<bullgard6> ben1u: ich empofehle  4096.\n<ben1u> das klingt in erster Linie schon logisch, nur muss ich bedenken, dass dann alle Dateien unter 4096 Bytes mehr Speicherplatz auf der Platte verbrauchen..\n<ben1u> das sind immerhin 13582 files\n<ben1u> oder ist das eine Milchm\u00c3\u00a4dchenrechnung?\n<LetoThe2nd> ben1u: wieviel ist 13582 * 4095bytes (worst case)\n<LetoThe2nd> dann reden wir weiter.\n<dreamon_> Mich w\u00c3\u00bcrde mal interessieren, wie Ihr das macht um in der Konsole zwischen diversen Pfaden zu wechseln, die man st\u00c3\u00a4ndig so braucht?

Ich kann hier locker einen UPNP Server aufsetzen und davon \u00c3\u00bcber den Receiver wiedergeben, aber ich m\u00c3\u00b6chte halt halbwegs komfortabel auch Playlists mit Musik aus unterschiedlichen Ordnern wiedergeben lassen...\n<rincewind> Jemand eine Idee?\n<subz3r0> xmbc?\n<rincewind> lol, nicht alle auf einmal ;) Wenn ihr einen Channel w\u00c3\u00bc\u00c3\u009ftet wo ich mit der Frage gut aufgehoben bin, w\u00c3\u00bcrde mir das auch schon helfen :D\n<rincewind> xbmc hab ich probiert, aber wiedergeben auf scheints da nicht zu geben, dass ist eher drauf ausgelegt von UPNP Servern wiederzugeben...\n<subz3r0> vlc kann auch streamen\n<rincewind> da f\u00c3\u00a4ngts schon an: wie kann ich denn mit VLC auf ein bestimmtes Ger\u00c3\u00a4t streamen? Ich wei\u00c3\u009f dass ich damit nen Stream starten kann und ich mich dann mit nem anderen Ger\u00c3\u00a4t per IP und Port draufschalten kann, aber ein Ger\u00c3\u00a4t f\u00c3\u00bcr den Stream angeben?\n<rincewind> Keine Ahnung wie, aber Win 7 mu\u00c3\u009f das irgendwie auf die Reihe bringen -.-\n<subz3r0> so streamst ins netz mit vlc. in dem receiver halt ip:port eingeben(sofern er es denn kann)\n<subz3r0> du...\n<rincewind> jo, brauch ich aber unter Win 7 eben nicht zu machen, da mach ich nur Receiver an und w\u00c3\u00a4hle in Windows 'wiedergeben auf', und genauso m\u00c3\u00b6cht ichs unter Linux haben. Ich hab auch kein Problem damit den Traffic von Windows zu sniffen und das selbst nachzubauen, ich dachte nur so ein Feature gibts schon l\u00c3\u00a4ngst unter Linux O.o\n<Loetmichel> rincewind: einfach vlc sagen da\u00c3\u009f es nur an EINE ip streamen darf\n<rincewind> Loetmichel, wie denn?\n<rincewind> also wo?\n<rincewind> X)\n<Loetmichel> gugg ins manual, da gibts ne option f\u00c3\u00bcr\n<Loetmichel> muss man glaube ich als option reinschreiben, nix gui\n<rincewind> hm, hast du da ein Stichwort f\u00c3\u00bcr?

Ja, habe noch den Gast-Account und einen anderen Account ohne Sudo-Rechne probiert, geht problemlos.\n<RedNifre> Hier mal lightdm.log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1128399/\n<kubine> Title: Ubuntu Pastebin (at paste.ubuntu.com)\n<RedNifre> Was vor dem Problem war: Rechner lief schon ca. 2 Tage lang, ich wollte etwas aus meinem EncFS-Container kopieren, da fiel mir auf, dass der gar nicht mehr gemountet war. Kam vorher schon mal vor, da das Mounten per Script geschiet dachte ich es w\u00c3\u00a4re am einfachsten, neu zu starten. Seitdem kann ich mich nicht mehr einloggen (nur per Kommandozeile)\n<RedNifre> Den Modus auf Ubuntu2D zu stellen hilft auch nicht.\n<sdx23> Das meinte ich mit Session. Gibt ja auch xterm, damit ist dann auszuschlie\u00c3\u009fen, dass es an der DE-Config liegt.\n<sdx23> Wenn du dich per Terminal einloggst, hast du dann alle Dateien? I.e. ist der Container gemountet?\n<sdx23> Im lightdmlog steht nichts hilfreiches.\n<RedNifre> Hmpf, anscheinend ist ein EncFS-Ordner leer. :(\n<RedNifre> Achso, moment.\n<RedNifre> Ich hatte das Mounten per GUI in den Autostart gelegt.\n<RedNifre> Also dieses Autostart-Men\u00c3\u00bc, dass man oben rechts in der Ubuntu-GUI hat.\n<RedNifre> \"Startprogramme\"\n<RedNifre> Wird das auch ausgef\u00c3\u00bchrt, wenn man per Kommandozeile rein geht?\n<RedNifre> Das EncFS scheint jedenfalls noch zu funktionieren, ich bin gerade an meinem anderen Rechner und die Dateien sind noch da (die EncFS-Krypto-Dateien liegen in der Dropbox)\n<sdx23> Dann w\u00c3\u00bcrde ich - wenn ich nur an einer L\u00c3\u00b6sung interessiert bin, nicht am Problem selbst - einfach die Daten auf einen neuen Account \u00c3\u00bcbertragen und die Konfiguration verwerfen.\n<RedNifre> K\u00c3\u00b6nnte man das Problem vielleicht auch ohne Fehlersuche l\u00c3\u00b6sen? Zum Beispiel einfach DejaDup sagen, es solle meinen Rechner auf den Zustand von vor zwei Tagen resettet oder so?\n<RedNifre> Habe DejaDup bisher noch nicht gebraucht, kann ich einfach Ubuntu komplett neu installieren und dann meinen Account vom Backup wieder herstellen?\n<RedNifre> (Falls nichts w\u00c3\u00a4ren keine Daten verloren, nur der ganze Einrichtungs-Aufwand)\n<sdx23> Du brauchst nichts neu installieren, wenn mit anderen Accounts alles funktioniert.\n<sdx23> H\u00c3\u00b6chstwahrscheinlich sind einfach irgendwelche Konfigurationsdateien (in deinem Home) fehlerhaft.\n<RedNifre> Ich w\u00c3\u00bcrde gerne meinen Benutzernamen behalten, geht das?\n<RedNifre> Ah.\n<RedNifre> Soll ich einfach wild konfigurationsdateien l\u00c3\u00b6schen?\n<sdx23> Ja, dann Benutzer l\u00c3\u00b6schen, mit selbem Namen neu anlegen.\n<sdx23> Oder das. Aber sicher vorher, was du hast.\n<RedNifre> Kann ich mich darauf verlassen, dass eh alles per DejaDup gesichert ist?\n<RedNifre> (Es hat immer automatisch mein home auf eine externe Platte gesichert).\n<RedNifre> Der fehlerhafte Account ist allerdings der einzige mit sudo-Rechten. Und ich habe Benutzerverwaltung bisher immer per GUI gemacht. Ich nehme an, ich muss einen user mit Sudo-Rechten anlegen, mit dem meinen Haupt-Account l\u00c3\u00b6schen, neu anlegen und dann den Hilfsaccount vom neuen Account aus l\u00c3\u00b6schen?\n<sdx23> RedNifre: ob du dich auf deine Sicherung verlassen kannst, musst du wissen. Zum Backup einrichten geh\u00c3\u00b6rt nicht nur, das Backup durchlaufen zu lassen, sondern auch zu testen, ob man zur\u00c3\u00bccksichern kann und dann alles wie beabsichtigt l\u00c3\u00a4uft.\n<RedNifre> In meinem Home sind viele Dateien namens .goutputstream-T7XZFW, bedeutet das was?\n<sdx23> Sagt mir nichts.\n<RedNifre> Wie testet man, ob zur\u00c3\u00bccksichern funktioniert?\n<sdx23> http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Baustelle/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_Dup?highlight=dejadup#Daten-wieder-herstellen \n<kubine> Title: D\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 Dup \u00e2\u0080\u00ba Baustelle \u00e2\u0080\u00ba Wiki \u00e2\u0080\u00ba ubuntuusers.de (at wiki.ubuntuusers.de)\n<RedNifre> Direkt nachdem man Ubuntu installiert hat mal probeweise zur\u00c3\u00bccksichern? Das Problem ist, dass ich erst den Account eingerichtet habe und sp\u00c3\u00a4ter das Backup benutzt habe.\n<RedNifre> Sprich, wenn die R\u00c3\u00bccksicherung nicht l\u00c3\u00a4uft w\u00c3\u00a4re ja alles weg.\n<RedNifre> Welche Config-Dateien kann ich denn l\u00c3\u00b6schen?\n<sdx23> RedNifre: Prim\u00c3\u00a4r die mit deiner XSession zu tun haben. Unity.\n<RedNifre> Sehe in meinem home nichts was nach Unity aussieht, aber es gibt .Xauthority. Die weg?\n<sdx23> Die hat damit nichts zu tun. Googelst du \"unity konfiguration\".\n<RedNifre> ah, ok.\n<sdx23> http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Unity/FAQ#Unity-zuruecksetzen\n<kubine> Title: FAQ \u00e2\u0080\u00ba Unity \u00e2\u0080\u00ba Wiki \u00e2\u0080\u00ba ubuntuusers.de (at wiki.ubuntuusers.de)\n<RedNifre> Hm, habe cat user gemacht, jetzt ist mein Charset verhunzt. Kann man da was machen?\n<RedNifre> Ach, egal, ich tippe blind, l\u00c3\u00b6sche die user-Datei und logge mich dann aus.\n<sdx23> reset\n<RedNifre> danke.\n<RedNifre> Also user l\u00c3\u00b6schen und hoffen?\n<RedNifre> Ich meine die Datei, nicht den ganzen Account.\n<RedNifre> ich mach mal...\n<RedNifre> Bringt schon mal nichts...\n<RedNifre> Die Datei wurde auch nicht neu angelegt, als ich gerade versucht habe, mich einzuloggen.\n<RedNifre> Der Fehler tritt also fr\u00c3\u00bcher auf. (?)\n<sdx23> Dann kommt er nicht so weit. Wom\u00c3\u00b6glich wird das encfs gar nicht gemountet.\n<RedNifre> Das kann ich ja erst mal rausnehmen. Wo finde ich den Kram, den man in der GUI unter \"Startprogramme\" einstellt? Dann nehme ich EncFS da erst mal raus.\n<RedNifre> (Ich w\u00c3\u00bcsste aber nicht, wieso EncFS die ganze Session lahmlegen sollte)\n<sdx23> Moment. Ist \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt dein gesamtes Home encfs?\n<RedNifre> Nein, nur ein Teil in der Dropbox.\n<RedNifre> Mein ganzes home ist allerdings verschl\u00c3\u00bcsselt.\n<RedNifre> Ich komme per Kommandozeile aber problemlos rein.\n<sdx23> Hm. So kommen wir jedenfalls nicht weiter.\n<RedNifre> Und dass EncFS nicht gemountet wird erkl\u00c3\u00a4re ich mir so, dass es in Unity per GUI als Startprogramm gelistet ist.\n<sdx23> Ja, das ist dann schon in Ordnung.\n<RedNifre> Nun gut, also account l\u00c3\u00b6schen, neu anlegen, versuchen per DejaDup wieder so hinzukriegen, wie er war, falls das nicht geht \u00c3\u00a4rgern, alles neu einrichten und die Daten aus der Dropbox und Git holen...\n<sdx23> Zwei M\u00c3\u00b6glichkeiten: Weiter in Logs suchen (lightdm greeter o\u00c3\u00a4 wom\u00c3\u00b6glich) und exakten Fehler finden. Oder: Neuen User anlegen und Dateien dahinschieben.\n<RedNifre> Wie mach ich das mit den Usern so, dass der alte heisst wie der neue?\n<RedNifre> und dass die Berechtigungen funktionieren und es nicht an allen Enden heisst \"Diese Datei geh\u00c3\u00b6rt dir nicht\"?\n<sdx23> L\u00c3\u00b6schen, neu anlegen. Aber ansich brauchst du nichtmal das. Schieb erstmal nur das ganze Home-Verzeichnis woanders hin.\n<sdx23> Danach die Daten in das neu angelegte Home zur\u00c3\u00bcckschieben, Verzeichnis f\u00c3\u00bcr Verzeichnis.\n<RedNifre> Ich kenn mich mit Kommandozeile nicht so aus. Bin gerade im kaputten Account eingeloggt, wo ich Sudo-Rechte habe. Will jetzt alles in einen Ordner im zweiten Account verschieben, der keine Sudo-Rechte hat. Dem Account m\u00c3\u00bcsste ich aber auch Rechte geben, damit ich \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt noch nen neuen Account anlegen kann, wenn der alte gel\u00c3\u00b6scht ist, oder?\n<sdx23> Ja. sudo adduser <neuer> admin (so hei\u00c3\u009ft die Gruppe)\n<sdx23> bzw. wom\u00c3\u00b6glich auch \"sudo\". Mach mal \"groups\" bei dir.\n<RedNifre> \"sudo adduser hilfsaccount admin\"?\n<sdx23> aye\n<RedNifre> In groups sehe ich den namen des kaputten accounts, jede Menge anderen kram aber nicht den anderen Account, der keine sudo-Rechte hat.\n<sdx23> RedNifre: den anderen sollst du auch nicht sehen. Nur ob da \"admin\" oder \"sudo\" steht.\n<RedNifre> da steht sudo und lpadmin\n<sdx23> dann ist's \"sudo adduser hilfsaccount sudo\"\n<RedNifre> also komplett: meinname adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n<RedNifre> \"Der Benutzer hilfsaccount existiert nicht\"\n<RedNifre> Kann ich nicht einfach dem zweiten Account sudo-Rechte geben? Dann spare ich mir den extra-Account. (Macht das Sinn?)\n<sdx23> Ja.\n<RedNifre> erledigt.\n<RedNifre> habe dem zweiten account auch einen Ordner kaputteshome in sein home gesudo mkdirt.\n<RedN1fre> huch\n<RedN1fre> Jedenfalls ist der zweite Account jetzt sudo und hat einen freien Ordner in seinem home.\n<RedN1fre> Wie verschiebe ich alles vom home des kaputten users zum zweiten account? Und kopiere ich dann nicht das Problem gleich mit?\n<sdx23> RedNifre: Tust du. Aber du sollst dann sp\u00c3\u00a4ter beim Zur\u00c3\u00bcckschieben nur das mitnehmen, was du brauchst. I.e. Daten, keine Konfigurationen.\n<RedN1fre> okay.\n<RedN1fre> Wie verschiebe ich per Kommandozeile alles aus meinem home in den ordner im home des anderen Users?\n<sdx23> rsync -avP /home/alt/* /home/neu/kaputteshome\n<RedN1fre> irgendwas failed, permission denied.\n<RedN1fre> Ach, sudo braucht man ja auch...\n<RedN1fre> Kopiert das, oder verschiebt es? Der Festplattenplatz reicht vermutlich nicht f\u00c3\u00bcr kopieren.\n<ppq> es kopiert\n<sdx23> ups. Ich sollte besser lesen. Ja, mv /home/alt/* /home/neu/kaputteshome\n<RedN1fre> Mit sudo nehme ich an?\n<RedN1fre> Die Tab-Vervollst\u00c3\u00a4ndigung setzt da noch ein / hinter kaputteshome, macht das irgend einen Unterschied?\n<sdx23> Hier nicht, nein. Bei rsync h\u00c3\u00a4tte es, beim ersten Parameter.\n<RedN1fre> Komisch, ich bekomme die Meldung \"Auf dem Ger\u00c3\u00a4t ist kein Speicherplatz mehr verf\u00c3\u00bcgbar\" (Nachdem der Befehl 1Minute lang irgendwas gemacht hat). Wie kann das bei mv \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt sein?\n<RedN1fre> es ist ein bisschen was in kaputteshome angekommen.\n<RedN1fre> vielleicht muss ich den Befehl einfach so oft wiederholen, bis alles dr\u00c3\u00bcben ist? :o)\n<DreamThief> :-X\n<ppq> hihi.\n<RedN1fre> oder geht dabei irgendwas verloren, zum Beispiel wenn ich einen halb verschobenen Ordner nochmal verschiebe (also dass dann die H\u00c3\u00a4lfte verschwindet, die schon kopiert wurde).\n<ppq> du k\u00c3\u00b6nntest den f\u00c3\u00bcr root reservierten bereich von 5% auf 1% runtersetzen, falls du das noch nicht gemacht hast\n<ppq> das gibt dir ein kleines plus an speicherplatz, evtl. reicht da\n<RedN1fre> Naja, das home sind so grob gesch\u00c3\u00a4tzt 30GB.\n<ppq> und du hast keine m\u00c3\u00b6glichkeit, das anderweitig auszulagern?\n<RedN1fre> Oh, doch, klar.\n<RedN1fre> Habe ja noch ne externe Festplatte.\n<RedN1fre> Moment...\n<ppq> uh, da musst du dann aber mit den rechten aufpassen. wenn das fat oder ntfs ist, gehen die verloren\n<ppq> da braucht's dann tar o.\u00c3\u00a4.\n<RedN1fre> Ist ext4\n<ppq> ah ok\n<ppq> dann kannst du ja obigen rsync befehl nutzen\n<RedN1fre> Also w\u00c3\u00bcrde ich den rsync-Befeh---\n<RedN1fre> genau.\n<RedN1fre> Wie war das da nochmal mit dem /\n<RedN1fre> also nach /media/festplatte/kaputteshome ohne slash?\n<sdx23> beim zweiten Argument ist's egal.\n<ppq> beim zielverzeichnis ist das afaik unwichtig\n<RedN1fre> gnnnh, jetzt ist durch den mv-Befehl ja die h\u00c3\u00a4lfte vom home woanders.\n<RedN1fre> Ich mv es erst mal wieder zur\u00c3\u00bcck.\n<RedN1fre> Grrrrh, oder \u00c3\u00bcberschreib ich mir das was? *Haare rauf*\n<ppq> rsync doch einfach aus beiden quellen auf deine externe hdd\n<RedN1fre> Ah, gute Idee!\n<RedN1fre> Okay, zu den Dateien, die in beiden homes auftauchen: Die haben in kaputteshome eine Dateigr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fe von 0.\n<RedN1fre> Die w\u00c3\u00bcrde ich lieber alle l\u00c3\u00b6schen, bevor ich kaputteshome rsynce.\n<RedN1fre> Sehe so spontan 6 davon direkt in kaputteshome, wei\u00c3\u009f aber nicht, wie viele davon noch in Unterordnern lauern.\n<RedN1fre> Kann man rsync sagen, dass es leere Dateien ignorieren soll?\n<RedN1fre> Oder kann ich die leeren Dateien l\u00c3\u00b6schen? (Also alle, auch welche, die evtl. in Unterordnern liegen)\n<RedN1fre> Wenn jemand wei\u00c3\u009f, wie viele Dateien mv gleichzeitig bearbeitet, w\u00c3\u00bcsste ich schon mal, wie viele 0-gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fen-Dateien hier rumliegen.\n<MarkusH> RedN1fre: find /path/to/search -empty\n<ppq> ich kenn mich da nicht so aus, aber k\u00c3\u00b6nnte es nicht auch sein, dass mv noch gar nichts gel\u00c3\u00b6scht hat in der quelle? und dementsprechend dort noch alles komplett ist\n<MarkusH> ggf noch ein \"-type f\" dran, damit du nur Dateien findest und keine leeren Ordner\n<RedN1fre> Nein, es fehlen definitiv Sachen im home, die in kaputteshome auftauchen. Und ein paar wenige Dateien sind in beidem, aber leer in kaputteshome.\n<RedN1fre> oh, die leeren Dateien geh\u00c3\u00b6ren root, die erfolgreich gemvten nicht.\n<RedN1fre> Ist es eine gute Idee alle Dateien zu l\u00c3\u00b6schen, die root geh\u00c3\u00b6ren? :) Nat\u00c3\u00bcrlich nur in diesem Unterordner und \".\" ausgenommen.\n<RedN1fre> Warum m\u00c3\u00bcssen sich Linux-Probleme eigentlich immer wie Operationen am offenen Herzen anf\u00c3\u00bchlen? :/\n<RedN1fre> \"Jetzt hier ein kleiner Einschnitt, vorsicht, sonst \u00c3\u00bcberschreibst du dir deine Daten mit leeren Dateien\".\n<RedN1fre> Ich hol mir erst mal nen Kaffee, brb.\n<ppq> *r\u00c3\u00a4usper* ein backup hast du hoffentlich? ;p\n<RedN1fre> nat\u00c3\u00bcrlich.

Also entweder, indem ich ihn repariere, oder indem ich einen neuen anlege, die Daten kopiere und vielleicht alles neu einstellen muss.\n<bekks> Abigoven: Was ist denn das konkrete Problem?\n<Abigoven> das Problem ist dass der aktuelle Sm auf XPCOM umgestellt wurde und jetzt seine eigenen Libs nicht findet - ein Rat war die Reihenfolge in dependendlibs.list umzuordnen\n<Abigoven> aber das hat nicht gefunzt\n<Abigoven> die Libs liegen btw im gleichen Verzeichnis\n<bekks> Hast du eine konkrete Problembeschreibung, inklusive Fehlermeldung?\n<RedN1fre> Also wenn normalerweise in einem Ordner keine Dateien root geh\u00c3\u00b6ren und ich jetzt sehe, dass fehlgeschlagene mv-Dateien die Gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fe 0 haben und root geh\u00c3\u00b6ren, wie kann ich dann in einem Ordner und Unterordnern alle Dateien l\u00c3\u00b6schen, die root geh\u00c3\u00b6ren und leer sind?\n<bekks> Abigoven: Und auf welchem Ubuntu bist du da ganz genau?\n<Abigoven> warte mal, ich starte mal\n<bekks> RedN1fre: evtl. mit find\n<RedN1fre> so was wie find irgendwelcheparameter | rm ?\n<RedN1fre> Und dabei hoffen, dass die find-parameter wirklich nur f\u00c3\u00bcr den Unterordner gelten und mir nicht sonst alles weg l\u00c3\u00b6schen?\n<ppq> find kann selbst l\u00c3\u00b6schen\n<bekks> Abigoven: Benutz einen pastebin-Service un NICHT MEIN QUERY!\n<RedN1fre> okay...\n<RedN1fre> Vermutlich k\u00c3\u00b6nnte ich mir per man-Page das zurechtsuchen, aber ich habe Angst, dass ich durch ne Fehlbedienung alles ab / l\u00c3\u00b6sche oder so.

In eine Hippie-Kolonie einwandern und nie wieder Computer nutzen?\n<RedN1fre> Auf dem Laptop, an dem ich gerade sitze, l\u00c3\u00a4uft noch 11.10 und zwar ziemlich stabil.

Sollte das nicht eigentlich die stabilere Version sein? \n<bekks> Ausser deinem aktuellen Problem wissen wir von keinen anderen Problemen.\n<RedN1fre> Gibt noch so komische Bugs, dass ich nicht in den Fensterinhalt klicken kann (Auf die drei Kn\u00c3\u00b6pfe im Fensterrahmen zu klicken geht noch). Dann hilft nur neu anmelden.\n<RedN1fre> Es ist auch schon zwei mal passiert, dass der Rechner einfach komplett eingefroren ist.\n<RedN1fre> Compiz beendet sich manchmal.\n<RedN1fre> Und es gibt diese sch\u00c3\u00b6nen Windows95-artigen Fehlermeldungen \"Ubuntu hat ein Problem, Fortfahren?\" (Auch recht selten, aber komisch ist es schon)\n<bekks> ISt bei mir noch nie passsiert.\n<bekks> Bei diesen \"Es wurde ein Problem festgestellt\"-Meldungen kann man sich auch die Details angucken, welches Programm die Meldung verursachte.\n<k1l_> RedN1fre: die fehlermeldungen kommen nur, weil das fehler-meldungs porgramm ver\u00c3\u00a4ndert wurde. die fehler waren vorher auch da nur jetzt wird man benachrichtigt\n<RedN1fre> ah, okay.\n<RedN1fre> Ich meine, das einzige was an meinem Setup besonders ist ist vielleicht das verschl\u00c3\u00bcsselte home.

Oder ist dein Laptop eh nur ein Terminal f\u00c3\u00bcr einen Server mit ner Ubuntu-VM, die auf einem ZFS sitzt oder so?\n<bekks> Was hat denn jetzt ZFS damit zu tun?\n<RedN1fre> Hm, in der Kommandozeile finde ich doch externe Laufwerke in /media, oder?\n<k1l_> RedN1fre: wenn sie gemountet sind\n<RedN1fre> Nun, ich sehe in /media den Namen meiner externen Festplatte, bekomme aber \"keine Berechtigung\" wenn ich per cd drauf schauen m\u00c3\u00b6chte.\n<bekks> Dann schau Dir doch die Berechtigungen an. ls -lha /media/\n<RedN1fre> Hm, anscheinend habe ich jetzt gar keinen Speicherplatz mehr frei.\n<RedN1fre> Ach, jetzt bootet es gar nicht mehr.\n<bekks> Weil kein Speicherplatz mehr frei ist.\n<bekks> Was soll ein Reboot daran auch \u00c3\u00a4ndern, dass die Platte voll ist.\n<RedN1fre> na, vielleicht irgendwelchen tempor\u00c3\u00a4ren kram l\u00c3\u00b6schen oder so.\n<RedN1fre> Jedenfalls kommt jetzt mountall: Keine Verbindung zu Plymouth.\n<RedN1fre> Ist die Frage, ob ich da jetzt wirklich noch Lust drauf habe, oder mich erst mal den Tag \u00c3\u00bcber in die Sonne lege und heute Abend Ubuntu neu installiere.\n<Guest24004> Hey, ausgehend von meiner Tante habe ich eine E-Mail bekommen: Inhalt ist eine scheinbar pers\u00c3\u00b6nliche Nachricht mit einem Link zu einer xx-Seite. Auch andere E-Mail Kontakte von ihr erhielten die gleiche Nachricht. Scheint eine Art Virus zu sein. Jeder der den Link anklickt, verbreitet die Seite weiter an seine Kontakte.

Ich habe so langsam den Eindruck, dass Reparieren l\u00c3\u00a4nger dauert.\n<bekks> RedN1fre: Du brauchst nicht neu zu installieren.\n<RedN1fre> Nun, wenn es gar nicht mehr bootet muss ich wohl eine Live-CD nutzen, mein home mit dem Master-Passwort entschl\u00c3\u00bcsseln, Kram l\u00c3\u00b6schen und hoffen dass es dann geht.\n<bekks> Exakt.\n<RedN1fre> Was mich gerade demotiviert: Alles neu einrichten dauert lange, aber vorraussehbar lange. Reparieren dauert wenn ich Gl\u00c3\u00bcck habe nicht lange, wenn ich Pech habe ewig.\n<RedN1fre> Nun gut, ich probier's per LiveCD...\n<RedN1fre> ...nach dem Mittagessen.

Hm.\n<bekks> Das nennt man logical block addressing.\n<RedN1fre> Also es meint nicht diese motorisierten Lesek\u00c3\u00b6pfe, die \u00c3\u00bcber die Platte huschen?\n<bekks> Das wird so \u00c3\u00bcbersetzt, unabh\u00c3\u00a4ngig davon, welche physikalischen eigenheiten die platte hat.\n<k1l_> RedN1fre: die ssds simulieren, dass sie eine normale festplatte w\u00c3\u00a4ren. sonst k\u00c3\u00b6nnte man die nicht einfach austauschen gegen normale hdds\n<bekks> Doch, es meint genau die Lesek\u00c3\u00b6pfe.\n<RedN1fre> Ich kenne mich mit Festplatten nicht so aus, aber sind nicht mehrere Disks gestapelt und ein Kamm aus Lesek\u00c3\u00b6pfen ist dazwischen geklemmt, ein Lesekopf pro Disk?

/usr/local/bin\n<mrkramps> oder nach %HOME/bin\n<yz3p> was ist denn der unterschied?\n<mrkramps> *$HOME/bin\n<yz3p> zischen usr bin und usr local bin ?\n<mrkramps> kein gro\u00c3\u009fer, aber in /usr/bin liegen schon alles binaries der installierten pakete\n<yz3p> und local bin ist leer\n<yz3p> ... also ist local f\u00c3\u00bcr selbstgemachtes?\n<mrkramps> in /usr/local/bin ist es normalerweise deswegen \u00c3\u00bcbersichtlicher fremdk\u00c3\u00b6rper im dateisystem wieder zu finden\n<yz3p> ok dann werde ich ma meine ganzen selbsterstellten nach local verschieben\n<mrkramps> es ist nicht explizit f\u00c3\u00bcr selbstgemachtes, aber bspw. wird beim kompilieren auch dieses verzeichnis als standardziel f\u00c3\u00bcr die installation verwendet\n<mrkramps> h\u00c3\u00a4lt halt paketinhalte und fremdinhalte etwas auseinander\n<mrkramps> besser noch kannst du es aber in deinem Homeverzeichnis unterbringen\n<mrkramps> sofern du kein mehrbenutzersystem hast\n<yz3p> wenn ich da ein /bin anlege findet bash ds dann \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt?\n<yz3p> *das\n<yz3p> oder muss ich dann immer $HOME/bin voranstellen?\n<mrkramps> yz3p, werf daf\u00c3\u00bcr mal einen blick in die datei ~/.profile\n<mrkramps> dort ist das erkl\u00c3\u00a4rt\n<mrkramps> aufbauend daf\u00c3\u00bcr auch Wiki-Artikel http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Umgebungsvariable\n<yz3p> ok den bin ordner  in $HOME kannte ich noch nicht, aber nur weil er standardm\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009fig nicht existiet ;)\n<mrkramps> yz3p, du kannst dort aber jenden anderen ordner eintragen\n<mrkramps> die Umgebungsvariable PATH gibt die verzeichnisse an, in denen direkt nach ausf\u00c3\u00bchrbaren dateien gesucht werden sollen\n<yz3p> ber ich mach sie doch lieber nach usr local bin, wenn mein profil ma crashen ollte kann ich dann mit dem 2. profil noch die porgs starten\n<yz3p> *progs\n<mrkramps> yz3p, da ist was dran\n<mrkramps> allerdings solltest du sie als kopie irgendwo sichern \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 stell dir vor du m\u00c3\u00bcsstest neu installieren ;)\n<yz3p> ja das ist der albtraum der mich jedesmal einhollt wenn ich was nicht fixen kann\n<yz3p> was ist denn jetzt noch der unterscheid zwischen bin und sbin?\n<yz3p> $PATH zeigt beide\n<mrkramps> s* = secure\n<mrkramps> die sind oftmals in Distributionen in PATH ausgeschlossen\n<yz3p> wieso denn das?\n<mrkramps> oder steht s* hier f\u00c3\u00bcr system!?\n<mrkramps> irgendwie war da was, weil dort in der regel programme liegen, die nur f\u00c3\u00bcr die systemadministration notwendig sind\n<yz3p> da liegt gparted also kann sein\n<mrkramps> das z.B. f\u00c3\u00bcr einen benutzer, der nicht auch systemadministrator ist, ziemlich egal\n<yz3p> ...aber da liegt auch lightdm\n<SunTsu> .o0( s - system )\n<mrkramps> SunTsu, ich kann mir diese ganzen erkl\u00c3\u00a4rungen immer nicht merken\n<SunTsu> yz3p: im sbin liegen die binaries zur Systemverwaltung, die die der Normaluser nicht braucht, in bin die binaries f\u00c3\u00bcr alle

nchrichtenfenster die hintergrundfarbe und schriftfarbe \u00c3\u00a4ndern\n<dadrc> Entweder es gibt da ein Addon f\u00c3\u00bcr, oder von Hand, siehe https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin#HowdoIchangethefontPidginusesThebackgroundcolor\n<dadrc> So generell ist Pidgin aber f\u00c3\u00bcr IRC eher ungeeignet\n<dadrc> Hexchat f\u00c3\u00bcr GTK, Konversation f\u00c3\u00bcr KDE, irssi f\u00c3\u00bcr Shell sind meistens die bessere Wahl\n<Bredo1988> okay malgucken\n<Bredo1988> bin sonst ganz zufrieden\n<Bredo1988> bin kein

hexchat\n<Bredo1988> mal gucken\n<Bredo1988> auf den ersten blick schonmal positiv\n<Bredo1988> ja, ich bleibe bei xchat\n<Bredo1988> danke f\u00c3\u00bcr die hilfe\n<dadrc> gerne\n<Bredo1988> vorteilhaft ist, dass ich nur noch ein fenster habe\n<Bredo1988> ist deutlich \u00c3\u00bcbersichtlicher\n<Bredo1988> bin dann mal weg was essen\n<Dulem> Mahlzeit! Ist euch ein Socks5 Proxy bekannt der ohne root l\u00c3\u00a4uft und bei dem man sich per user:password@server:port authentifizieren kann?\n<Dulem> Was dann letztendlich auch mit dem Firefox klappen sollte.\n<LetoThe2nd> Dulem: ich w\u00c3\u00bcrde mir einfach das tor browser bundle mal genauer anschauen, da ist ja so was drin.\n<Dulem> LetoThe2nd: Ich bin sowieso mit einem VPN unterwegs, ab und an ben\u00c3\u00b6tige ich aber eine deutsche IP. Das w\u00c3\u00bcrde ich dann gerne per Proxy \u00c3\u00bcber meinen Server in DE laufen lassen. (Damit ich meinen VPN nicht komplett abschalten muss)\n<Dulem> Tor m\u00c3\u00b6chte ich vermeiden.\n<LetoThe2nd> Dulem: ich habe ja auch nicht gesagt: \"nimm das tbb\", ich sagte \"schau dir mal an was da drin ist.\"\n<Etarius> mahlzeit, kennt sich wer mit apparmor bzw der stellung von profilen aus \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 br\u00c3\u00a4uchte hilfe beim erstellen von einem profil f\u00c3\u00bcr wine\n<addiks> hi, wei\u00c3\u009f zuf\u00c3\u00a4llig jemand wie man den wl Treiber (aus dem Paket bcmwl-kernel-source) mit einem selbstbegauten kernel installieren kann? Bei Paketinstallation: \"ERROR (dkms apport): kernel package linux-headers-3.15.0-rc5-custom is not supported\"\n<dadrc> DKMS braucht nicht nur den Kernel, sondern auch die entsprechenden Header. Sind die vorhanden?\n<addiks> jap, die sind auch installiert.\n<maze-m> moinsen! \n<maze-m> Kann mir einer von euch sagen, wie ich einen zweiten Monitor an nem zweiten Displayport so angesteuert bekomme, dass ich das Bild auf dem zweiten Monitor erweitern kann? Also Windowsmanager habe ich xfce laufen. Habe auch schon versucht, mit xrandr das einzustellen, aber da wird der zweite Monitor nicht erkannt.\n<addiks> Ich seh grad in der make.log viele Fehlermeldungen in der Art: \" ... error: too few arguments to function \u00e2\u0080\u0098cfg80211_ibss_joined\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ...\" Also eher ein Problem mit dem code als mit dem custom-kernel? Was macht man da?\n<maze-m> lspci sagt mir zu der Grafikkarte folgendes: \"VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller\"\n<maze-m> ich kann halt mein Desktop komischerweise nicht erweitern, sondern nur clonen sozusagen\n<addiks> Details: http://nopaste.euirc.net/index.php?id=46f736c066 und http://nopaste.euirc.net/index.php?id=91363edac0\n<letothe2nd> addiks: vmtl. passt die kernel version auf die der treiber aufsetzt einfach nicht zu dem was bei dir im einsatz ist.\n<dadrc> maze-m, was sagt `xrandr | grep connected`?\n<letothe2nd> addiks: 3.15 vs. 3.13 oder 3.2 ist da nat\u00c3\u00bcrlich echt durchschalgen.\n<letothe2nd> *durchschlagend.\n<addiks> letothe2nd: wie kommst du auf 3.13 bzw. 3.2? Ich kann dir gerade nicht ganz folgen.\n<letothe2nd> addiks: naja. ich *nehme* jetzt einfach mal an, dass du ein ubuntu hast. aus dem ziehst du die bcmwl-sourcen. bei 14.04 ist z.b. der 3.13er mit drin, also passen die treibersourcen dazu. dein dkms sagt, dass du 3.15-rc5 hast. alles klar?\n<letothe2nd> (3.2 war der von 12.04, den rest weiss ich nicht auswendig.)\n<addiks> Ich habe 3.15-rc5 als selbstgebauten kernel installiert. Ich brauche mindestens 3.14 wegen dem thunderbolt support und einigen patches die ansonsten kernel-panics ausl\u00c3\u00b6sen.\n<letothe2nd> addiks: ich wollte auch keine rechtfertigung h\u00c3\u00b6ren, ich sagte dir nur warum der treiber nicht kompiliert.\n<maze-m> dadrc: das sagt mir 'Can't open display' :/\n<letothe2nd> addiks: ergo: entweder den treiber vorw\u00c3\u00a4rts protieren, bzw. drauf warten dass es wer macht - oder drauf verzichten - oder so lange noch den alten kernel verwenden.\n<maze-m> is ja nen bischen komisch, dass er sagt 'can't open display'.... Hab ja zwei Monitore dran angeschlossen\n<addiks> letothe2nd: mhh, ok. Trotzdem danke f\u00c3\u00bcr die Hilfe. Der alte Kernel ist f\u00c3\u00bcr mich halt keine Option.\n<dadrc> maze-m, das ist dann allerdings komisch.\n<maze-m> dadrc: kann das denn mit'm Treiber zu tun haben?\n<maze-m> ich mein, eigentlich w\u00c3\u00a4re das dann ja das naheliegendste. find's nur ein bischen komisch, dass ich das Bild zwar geclont bekomme, aber es nicht m\u00c3\u00b6glich ist, es zu erweitern.\n<testdr> maze-m: wer \"clont\" das Bild? .. ist das vielleicht im bios eine Einstellung ...?\n<maze-m> testdr: kann man sowas im bios einstellen? \n<testdr> maze-m: es gab sogar alte laptops, die hatten eine so schwache graka, die konnten nur spiegeln .. waren gedacht zum Anschluss an gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009feren Bildschirm oder projektor ..\n<dadrc> maze-m, m\u00c3\u00b6glich ist das schon, aber eigentlich sind die inteltreiber ganz ordentlich\n<testdr> maze-m: \u00c3\u00a4ndert aber nichts an Deiner Antwort, dass Du offenbar nicht wei\u00c3\u009ft was zur Zeit passiert. Wer clont die Grafikausgabe?\n<maze-m> testdr: okay, ich hab gerade mal im Bios geguckt und da war \"Auto\" f\u00c3\u00bcr das Video device eingestellt. \n<testdr> maze-m: wenn Du schon nachgeschaut hast, welche Optionen gab es denn da au\u00c3\u009fer \"Auto\"?\n<maze-m> ich hab das mal auf igp umgestellt und da dann den Multi-Monitor-Support auf enabled gesetzt\n<maze-m> aber ein `xrandr | grep connected` sagt mir trotzdem das Gleiche\n<testdr> maze-m: ist der 2te Monitor dunkel .. oder wird da immer noch \"nur\" gespiegelt?\n<testdr> maze-m: und abgesehen von \"connected\", schau nach ob \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt der 2te Grafikausgang erkannt wird .. (der dann disconnected w\u00c3\u00a4re)\n<maze-m> testdr: h\u00c3\u00a4tte im bios unter 'Devices --> Video Setup --> Select Active Video' das ausw\u00c3\u00a4hlen: IGP, PEG, PCI, Auto \n<maze-m> testdr: der zweite Monitor wird nur gespiegelt. \n<maze-m> testdr: wie guck ich denn, ob der 2te Grafikausgang erkannt wird?\n<testdr> maze-m: argh .. indem Du die ganze Ausgabe von xrandr anschaust .. Grafikausg\u00c3\u00a4nge nennen sich dann z.B. VGA-0, VGA-1, DVI-D-0, DVI-D-1, HDMI-0 u.s.w\n<maze-m> okay, mom \n<maze-m> testdr: aber nur 'xrandr' in'er Shell eingegeben gibt mir auch aus: \"Can't open display\"!\n<dadrc> Da l\u00c3\u00a4uft aber schon gerade ein x, ja?\n<maze-m> dadrc: na ja, ich hab das jetzt \u00c3\u00bcber ne ssh-session gemacht. oder muss ich das auf nem ge\u00c3\u00b6ffneten terminal direkt am pc machen?\n<dadrc> ja\n<dadrc> mhm.\n<testdr> mann .. bei \"xrandr | grep connected\"  zeigt keine \u00c3\u0084nderung h\u00c3\u00a4tte ich darauf erstmal nicht getippt ..\n<dadrc> maze-m, probier mal `DISPLAY=:0 xrandr | grep connected`\n<dadrc> Das sollte auch \u00c3\u00bcber SSH gehen\n<dadrc> Wenn das X denn an sich l\u00c3\u00a4uft\n<maze-m> dadrc: okay, ein \"xrandr\" zeigt mir folgendes an: http://paste.debian.net/112660/\n<maze-m> testdr: sorry....\n<dadrc> nur die 3 zeilen? sonst nichts?\n<testdr> ist wahrscheinlich ein spezial-xrandr ... l\u00c3\u00a4sst die Ausgabedevices weg ..\n<dadrc> steht ja eins dran: \"default\"\n<maze-m> dadrc: ne, sonst steht da nichts drin\n<testdr> dadrc: seit wann nennt sich so eine Grafikausgabe: default? ...

Eventuell mal bei den Bugs von libmodplug1 gucken, vielleicht gibt es da einen Hinweis dazu\n<Etarius> habe da eine spur \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 liegt eher was daran dass das modplug nur f\u00c3\u00bcr i386 vom entwickler stammt und naja es aber ja auch unter anderen systemen laufen kann \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 bestimmt haben die weiterf\u00c3\u00bchrenden leute da ein bischlen geschlampt beim abh\u00c3\u00a4nigkeiten setzten \n<geser> libmodplug1 ist noch nicht daf\u00c3\u00bcr vorbereitet, dass man die i386 und amd64 Version parallel installieren kann\n<Etarius> re \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 achso okay geser\n<NTQ> Hallo Leute. Kann mir jemand Tipps geben bez\u00c3\u00bcglich einer Backupsoftware, die auf einem entfernen Server laufen soll. Sie soll m\u00c3\u00b6glichst einfach konfigurierbar sein per Config-File oder passwortgesch\u00c3\u00bctztem Webinterface. Es sollen verschiedene /home-Ordner gepackt (.tar.gz) und auf einen FTP geschoben werden.\n<sysdef> warum das webinterface sichern, wenn die daten undesichert uebertragen werden? damit es geichert ist, dass die daten ungesichert uebertragen werden? das ist das konzept?\n<testdr> NTQ: prinzipiell sind das 3 Befehle .. tar-packen, ftp \u00c3\u009cbertragung, lokales tar-paket l\u00c3\u00b6schen ... das macht man wohl mit einem script ..\n<sysdef> es wird kaum backupsoftware geben, die unverschluesselte authentifizierung und datenoffenlegung unterstuetzt, da das konzept sehr unueblich ist\n<NTQ> sysdef: Die Daten werden nur innerhalb des Strato-Rechenzentrums verschoben, da die uns einen FTP-Backupsspace zur Verf\u00c3\u00bcgung stellen.\n<NTQ> Oder was meint ihr mit Datenoffenlegung?\n<testdr> NTQ: dann w\u00c3\u00bcrde ich die Daten aber lokal verschl\u00c3\u00bcsseln .. \n<sysdef> FTP ist unverschluesselt, jeder kann mit deinen zugangsdaten die daten lesen, loeschen, manipulieren\n<NTQ> Naja, man kann eh nur von unserem Server auf den FTP-Server einloggen. Von au\u00c3\u009fen geht das nicht.\n<NTQ> Das wird von Strato schon unterbunden. Man muss also sowieso auf dem Server sein um sich auf dem FTP einloggen zu k\u00c3\u00b6nnen.\n<NTQ> Wahrscheinlich eine IP-Sperre oder sowas.\n<sysdef> soweit ich das strato RZ und dessen ftp-loesung kenne, kann das jeder im RZ abgreifen, der dort einen server mietet\n<Etarius> klingt sehr leichtsinnig\n<NTQ> Achso, das wei\u00c3\u009f ich nicht. Aber ein passwortgesch\u00c3\u00bctztes tar-Archiv sollte ja nicht so das Problem darstellen.\n<sysdef> bei verschluesselten backups kann man sie nicht mehr lesen und nicht mehr manipulieren, nur noch loeschen\n<testdr> NTQ: hast Du die 3 Befehle zusammen? (jetzt mit Verschl\u00c3\u00bcsselung eben 4)\n<NTQ> Ja, da gebe ich dir auch Recht.\n<NTQ> Ja, die drei Befehle kenne ich schon. Ich dachte nur da k\u00c3\u00b6nnte mir etwas die Arbeit abnehmen bez\u00c3\u00bcglich automatischem L\u00c3\u00b6schen alter Backups auf dem FTP bei \u00c3\u009cberschreiten eines Limits. Und einfaches Konfigurieren weiterer Ordner usw.\n<NTQ> Auf irgendeinem \u00c3\u00a4lteren Server haben wir da Areca laufen. Das gef\u00c3\u00a4llt mir aber nicht so gut irgendwie. Deshalb wollte ich mal in die Runde fragen.\n<testdr> arcea?\n<NTQ> http://www.areca-backup.org/\n<testdr> aha .. danke\n<Etarius> hmm ist ein dd | gzip auch okay? C:\n<NTQ> Mit dd kann man eher block devices oder zusammenh\u00c3\u00a4ngende Dateien kopieren, oder? Also keine ganzen Verzeichnisse\n<Etarius> hmm eigentlich auch verzeichnisse\n<Etarius> musst ja nicht immer die /dev/sdX holen ;)\n<SunTsu> NTQ: Auch ganze Verzeichnisse, aber das ist nicht einfach, Du musst die Sektoren kennen und genau lesen/schreiben. Das braucht viel Expertenwissen\n<NTQ> Also Unsinn in dem Fall und ein R\u00c3\u00bcckspielen w\u00c3\u00a4re vermutlich noch mehr Aufwand ;)\n<sysdef> NTQ: lftp kann ueber ftp syncen. wenn du lokal genug platz hast die letzten n backups lokal liegen zu lassen kannst du mit --delete abgleichen\n<NTQ> sysdef: Interessante Idee\n<sysdef> http://www.webmaster-support.net/Kleines-lftp-Howto.html\n<NTQ> Aktuell sind noch 1,7 TB frei von 1,8 TB xD. Ich glaube das ist gut. :)\n<SunTsu> NTQ: ich nutze bacula, aber das ist eher nicht einfach, daf\u00c3\u00bcr sehr gut und flexibel\n<NTQ> Mit lftp kenne ich mich aus. Hatte da schon mal ein Backupskript irgendwo anders gebastelt.\n<NTQ> Naja, gut. Ich denke ich baue dann was eigenes. Dann kann auch grad noch die MySQL-Datenbanken mit sichern.\n<sysdef> NTQ: ggf. auch interessant: http://www.butschek.de/fachartikel/perl-mysql-backup/\n<NTQ> Danke. Sehr interessant. Ich habe das bisher immer per mysqldump gemacht. Aber unsere Datenbanken waren auch recht klein. Maximal 10-20 GB\n<NTQ> Allerdings nutzen wir auch InnoDB\n<SunTsu> NTQ: duplicity ist \u00c3\u00bcbrigens auch nicht schlecht, das kann auch inkrementelle backups, via ssh, ftp, etc\n<dreamon> Gabe gerade 14.04 installiert.. das lief bis grub installation tadellos.

Du hast auch nicht meine frage nach der partitionierung beantwortet .. ob genug platz ist .. und das \"root-directory\" f\u00c3\u00bcr den grub2-install willst du auch nicht angeben ..\n<testdr> ich finde meine glaskugel .. nicht zum raten..\n<dreamon> Ok, also machen wir mal deinen Weg. sda ist voller windows Partitionen\n<dreamon> sdb1, ist nfts, sdb2 ist extended und sdb5 ist etx4 mit Ubuntu .., sdb6 ist swap\n<testdr> dreamon: wenn auf sda der grub geschrieben werden soll, dann muss am Anfang genug platz sein und der ist f\u00c3\u00bcr grub2 gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fer geworden ..\n<testdr> wenn auf sdb5 das root von ubuntu mit dem boot-verzeichnis ist, dann muss das in der live-version gemountet werden und der mount-punkt beim grub-install angegeben werden -- steht auch so im wiki .. aber dein befehl hat das nicht enthalten\n<dreamon> /dev/sda1 ist 109.79MB gro\u00c3\u009f und sind nur 7.27MB verwendet.\n<testdr> dreamon: grub2 braucht vor sda1 platz . .. nicht darin .. der erste Sektor muss mittlerweile bei block 2048 anfangen ...\n<dreamon> grub-install    --root-directory=/dev/sda5  -> Aber das ist ja nicht ein Pfad\n<testdr> dreamon: ?? mount    /dev/sda5    /mnt       .... und dann wird /mnt angegeben .. das ist ein Pfad .. steht auch so im wiki\n<dreamon> sda1 f\u00c3\u00a4ngt bei Sektor 63 an und ist ein fat16 -> Wieviel platz das aber ist?\n<testdr> dreamon: das ist zu wenig ... man kann da ein force beim install versuchen .. das kann aber sp\u00c3\u00a4ter probleme bringen .. weil grub nur verweise dort speichert ...\n<dreamon> Also -> grub-install    --root-directory=/mnt  \n<testdr> und dann noch wo .. also wohl auf festplatte ein: /dev/sda\n<testdr> s/ein/eins/\n<dreamon> Also -> grub-install   /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt  \n<testdr> ja - wenn du richtig ge-mountet hast und dann sollte von grub der Hinweis auf zu wenig platz kommen\n<dreamon> Ok, weiter sind wir gekommen. warning: sektor 32 is already in use by the programm \"flexnet\"; avoiding it. this software may cause boot or other problems in future. Please ask author ..blabla\n<dreamon> soll ich mal rebooten und testen?\n<dreamon> Keine Ahnung was das flexnet ist.. vielleicht eine netzwerkbootm\u00c3\u00b6glichkeit\n<testdr> dreamon: so .. und nun merkst du hoffentlich worauf ich hinaus wollte ... und ... --- ja, du kannst testen ... im schlimmsten fall geht nichts mehr .. und du musst zum alten grub-1.0 zur\u00c3\u00bcck .. \n<testdr> dreamon: sektor 63 ist zuwenig -- selbst bei grub-1.0 hatte ich da immer 64\n<dreamon> testdr, Sorry. Ich hab das mit dem Wiki schon so oft gemacht, das ich dachte das ist easy\n<dreamon> Jetzt lande ich in der Grub bash\n<testdr> dreamon: das ist der erste und gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fte fehler,denn du machen kannst -- es ist nicht \"easy\" -- sp\u00c3\u00a4testens wenn nichts mehr bootet, dann merkst du es . zu sp\u00c3\u00a4\n<testdr> t\n<dreamon> Ich bin da relativ entspannt, weil ichs bisher immer hinbekommen hab :)\n<testdr> dreamon: ja .. d.h. grub kann den rest nicht nachladen ... bleibt die frage ob du in der partitionierung platz schaffen kannst oder definitiv nicht grub-2 nehmen kannst ...\n<dreamon> Ich frage mich f\u00c3\u00bcr was diese sda Partition da ist. Einfach l\u00c3\u00b6schen will ich sie aber auch nicht. Vielleicht die Gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fe \u00c3\u00a4ndern, oder bekomm ich dann stress das XP nicht mehr geht..hmm\n<testdr> dreamon: sda ist keine partition ---    sda ist die ganze erste festplatte ... und wenn du da l\u00c3\u00b6schst ...\n<testdr> dreamon: da ich windows nicht leiden .. kann .. k\u00c3\u00b6nnte ich sagen .. mach nur ... ?? --\n<NTQ> SunTsu: duplicity ist wirklich h\u00c3\u00bcbsch. Gef\u00c3\u00a4llt mir. Danke\n<dreamon> meine sda1\n<testdr> dreamon: wenn du einen usb-stick hast, dann installier dir die super-grub-disk und nimm die um das grub-menu auf der 2.ten festplatte in sdb5 zu starten ..\n<testdr> dreamon: dann musst du \u00c3\u00bcberlegen ob du auf einen ganz anderen boot-loader ausweichst, wenn du nicht genug platz schaffen kannst ...\n<dreamon> /dev/sda1 zeigt in gparted hinten als flag diag an. warum sollte ich die nicht entfernen oder etwas verkeinern\n<dreamon> Sag Feige und ich machs\n<testdr> dreamon: ... ich wei\u00c3\u009f ja nicht was auf sda1 drauf ist .. vielleicht windows-installationsdateien .. und wenn da nicht alles belegt ist, dann kannst du versuchen die mit gparted am Anfang etwas zu verkleiner .. dh. den anfang nach hinten zu schieben\n<testdr> dreamon: wenn es aber eine benutzte windows-partition ist ... -- ist wohl jetzt auch wurscht ..da du die so nicht mehr booten kannst ...\n<testdr> d.h. soll sagen du wirst kaum eine live-windows-boot-cd haben um einen partitions-check zu machen ...\n<dreamon> Leider bricht gparted ab. mit einer einem Hexdump.. hm\n<NTQ> Mit testdisk kann man doch schnell mal schauen, was das alles so f\u00c3\u00bcr Partitionen sind und auch das Verzeichnis durchst\u00c3\u00bcbern.\n<testdr> dreamon: ist den auf der 2.festplatte vorne genug platz ... mindestens 64 sektoren, besser 2048\n<dreamon> testdr, bei sdb1 steht first sector 2048\n<dreamon> Aber wenn ich grub auf sdb schreibe, dann bootet er doch immer erst sda ?\n<testdr> dreamon: ich wei\u00c3\u009f halt nicht wie windows darauf reagiert .. wenn es nicht mehr die erste festplatte ist -- jedenfalls k\u00c3\u00b6nntest du die festplatten im bios umsetzten -- oder eben auf dem mainboard umstecken .. und bekommst dann wenigstens die zum booten, wenn du dann den grub2 dort installierst ..\n<testdr> dreamon: man kann beim booten des rechners per F-taste (meistens) festlegen von welchem datentr\u00c3\u00a4ger gebootete werden soll ...\n<testdr> dann w\u00c3\u00bcrde erstmal das installierte ubuntu f\u00c3\u00bcr dich laufen .. mit dem hinkefu\u00c3\u009f immer erst \u00c3\u00bcber diese boot-auswahl-liste zu gehen ..\n<testdr> und da das ubuntu auf der 2ten festplatte l\u00c3\u00a4uft - kannst du von dort schaun ob du das windows auf der 1.ten platte irgendwie verschieben kannst .. oder - wie gesagt - vielleicht einen anderen boot-loader installierst, der dann einen \"chain-load\" auf den von der 2.ten Festplatte macht ..\n<testdr> dreamon: also machst du erst den grub-install nochmal .. mit dem richtigen mount aber auf /dev/sdb\n<testdr> wo ja genug platz ist am anfang der partition\n<dreamon> testdr, Ok habs hinbekommen\n<dreamon> Auf eine eine etwas andere Art, aber Wirkungsvoll.\n<dreamon> Habe einfach den vorderen Bereich mit Nullen gekillt, dann konnte ich ganz normal mit \"grub-install /dev/sda\" installieren. Ohne Fehlermeldung und ich kann windows und Ubuntu booten!\n<testdr> dreamon: war afk -- ok ... dann war es zu wenig platz auf sda vor der 1.partition .. --- fragt sich nur was windows dazu sagt, wenn da was fehlt, bzw. wenn dort die windows-boot-installation lag (die sp\u00c3\u00a4ter nur noch gebraucht wird, wenn windows neu installiert werden muss) ...\n<dreamon> testdr, Halb so wild ist nur XP... das l\u00c3\u00a4uft eh nicht mehr lange.. \n<testdr> dreamon: trotzdem w\u00c3\u00bcrde ich empfehlen auch einen grub-install (aus dem laufenden ubuntu-system) auf die /dev/hdb zu machen, damit du da auch einen installierten bootmanager hast ... der \u00c3\u00bcber die bios-bootreihenfolge ausgew\u00c3\u00a4hlt werden k\u00c3\u00b6nnen m\u00c3\u00bcsste ..\n<dreamon> grub-install war zu harmlos, als das es trotzdem dr\u00c3\u00bcbergebrettert w\u00c3\u00a4re. Ich habs auch auf sdb installiert..\n<dreamon> testdr, Aber ich hab wieder was dazu gelernt.

Ich habe schon gegoogled aber leider suche ich anscheinend falsch.\n<phillip> Guest94369: nutzt du ubuntu gnome?\n<Guest94369> ja \n<phillip> Guest94369: okey, kenne ich mich nicht zu gut aus, aber in hast du in den Einstellungen keine M\u00c3\u00b6glichkeit gefunden?\n<testdr> Guest94369: .. unter metacity (dem fallback) geht es wohl mit dem gconf-editor und dort unter apps->metacity->.. global-keybindings\n<Guest94369> leider nicht, aber ich habe eine Alternative so eben gefunden. mit AltGr+Alt+Right+RightClick geht es auch, aber werde mal eben bei Metacity schauen\n<testdr> Guest94369: die Einstellungen werden normalerweise im homeverzeichnis in   .gonf/... abgelegt\n<Guest94369> danke f\u00c3\u00bcr eure Hilfe, mit der gefunden Alternative kann ich im Moment auch arbeiten :) aber der hier gebotene Support, wird seinem Ruf gerecht.\n<byte> n8\n<axd> Guten Abend, sagt mal ist es m\u00c3\u00b6glich Ubuntu (oder jede andere Distru) so zu konfigurieren das - sobald ein neues Ger\u00c3\u00a4t, USB-Stick etc - angeschlossen wird eine Meldung an ein anderes Endger\u00c3\u00a4t geht und ggf, dar\u00c3\u00bcber das \"Heimsystem\" gespeert wird? \n<bekks> Da ist es einfacher USB abzuschalten.\n<axd> Hm,  aber genau das m\u00c3\u00b6chte ich nicht.\n<axd> Ich denke \u00c3\u00bcber eine externe Kontrolle via Pi nach - oder einem Software Detektor - aber k.a wie ich das so zum laufen bekommen soll. hm..\n<bekks> Was m\u00c3\u00b6chtest du denn letztendlich wirklic realisieren?\n<axd> Ich m\u00c3\u00b6chte das ein Ger\u00c3\u00a4t von einem anderen Ger\u00c3\u00a4t \u00c3\u00bcberwacht und ggf, kontrolliert wird. \n<bekks> Das ist bereits Teil deines L\u00c3\u00b6sungsansatzes. Was m\u00c3\u00b6chtest du genau tun?\n<bekks> M\u00c3\u00b6chtest du nur \"freigegebene\" USB Ger\u00c3\u00a4te benutzen k\u00c3\u00b6nnen?\n<axd__> sorry, dc - so. Nochmal zur\u00c3\u00bcck zu deiner Frage. \n<axd__> Ja, wie du schon vermutet hast. Es sollen nur \"freigegebene\" USB-Ger\u00c3\u00a4te benutzt werden. Jedem Ger\u00c3\u00a4t wird ein Wert zugeordnet und sobald ein Ger\u00c3\u00a4t entfernt wird ist dieser Wert nicht mehr G\u00c3\u00bcltig und das Ger\u00c3\u00a4t wird als ein neues \"unbekanntes\" und \"irregul\u00c3\u00a4res\" Ger\u00c3\u00a4t angesehen. \n<axd__> Und es muss erst durch einen Administrator_in freigeschaltet werden. \n<bekks> Alles ab dem dritten Satz ist wieder nur ein L\u00c3\u00b6sungsansatz.\n<bekks> Wenn du nur \"freigegebene\" Ger\u00c3\u00a4te benutzen willst, dann \u00c3\u00a4ndere die udev-Regeln so, dass auch nur die freigegebenen Ger\u00c3\u00a4te einen Devicenode erhalten, und alle anderen nicht. Dann brauchst du auch keinen Rechner zu sperren.\n<bekks> Wenn du eine \"online\" L\u00c3\u00b6sung daf\u00c3\u00bcr wilst, in der der Admin per Mausklick auf die Anfrage eines Users reagieren kann, wirst du um sehr teure kommerzielle L\u00c3\u00b6sungen nicht herumkommen.\n<axd__> hm.. dann muss ich eine kreativere L\u00c3\u00b6sung finden. \n<axd__> Danke dir aber.\n#ubuntu-de 2014-08-02\n<frybye> Gibt es ein Berlin-ubuntu-crack der interesse hat etwas on-site ubuntu lehre/hilfe zu leisten und als gegenleistung English conversation von ein Mutter-spr\u00c3\u00a4chler?\n<frybye> bin in Bln-tempelhof zu finden..\n<frybye> Ich biete wissens-tausch - english conversation (mother-toungue-) gegen ubuntu-lehre-hilfe?\n<frybye> standort - bln-tempelhof\n<dreamon> Verwendet jemand parcellite ?

Seit etwa 2 Stunden habe ich aus blauem Himmel heraus sehr seltsame Netzwerkprobleme. Ich bin per WLan mit dem Router verbunden, kann aber keine Websites aufrufen und kann den Router auch nicht anpingen. Auch dann nicht, wenn ich per Lan Kabel verbunden bin. Bei allen anderen Ger\u00c3\u00a4ten im Netzwerk (Anderer Laptop, Smartphones, etc.) funktioniert alles einwandfrei. \n<dadrc> Auch nach 'nem Neustart nicht?\n<x42> hast du ne g\u00c3\u00bcltige ip\n<waldemar> Ich hab schon den Router neu gestartet und auch den Laptop neu gestartet, aber das hat nicht geholfen\n<x42> kannst du das laptop von einem anderen device anpingen?\n<waldemar> also die ip kann ich \u00c3\u00bcber ifconfig rausbekommen oder?\n<x42> ja\n<dadrc> waldemar, was war denn vor 2 Stunden? Irgendwelche Updates installiert oder sowas?\n<waldemar> hm, von dem Funktionierenden Laptop habe ich die IP 192.168.178.23, von dem nicht funktionierenden ist die ip 192.168.66.101 \n<waldemar> als ob es in einem anderen Netz w\u00c3\u00a4re\n<waldemar> \u00c3\u00bcber LAN Kabel ist die IP 192.168.66.103\n<dadrc> aber du hast die IP nicht von Hand gesetzt?\n<waldemar> nein\n<dadrc> Versuch mal, dir \u00c3\u00bcber DHCP eine neue IP zu holen\n<dadrc> `sudo dhclient wlan0`\n<dadrc> (oder wie auch immer deine wlan-Karte hei\u00c3\u009ft)\n<waldemar> Ja, so hei\u00c3\u009ft die Karte, aber ich habe wieder die gleiche Adresse bekommen\n<dadrc> Das klingt dann f\u00c3\u00bcr mich so, als h\u00c3\u00a4tte jemand einen zweiten DHCP-Server in dein Netzwerk geh\u00c3\u00a4ngt\n<dadrc> Zweiter Router irgendwo? Jemand mit 'nem Laptop, der sich einen Spa\u00c3\u009f erlaubt?\n<waldemar> Kann ich mir nicht vorstellen\n<waldemar> Aber das problem ist aufgetreten, als meine Freundin sich mit dem Wlan verbunden hat\n<dadrc> Dann wirf die mal testweise aus dem WLAN\n<waldemar> aber die ist absolut nicht in der Lage dazu, einen DHCP server einzurichten\n<ppq> ist das ein windows-ger\u00c3\u00a4t?\n<dadrc> waldemar, naja, nicht absichtlich. Aber vielleicht hat sie da irgendwas drauf, wer wei\u00c3\u009f.\n<dadrc> Anders kann ich mir das mit IPs aus einem anderen Netz nicht erkl\u00c3\u00a4ren.\n<dadrc> Ansonsten halt mit wireshark gucken, woher die DHCP-Pakete kommen\n<waldemar> hm, ok. Wir haben hier irgendwie einen Repeater im Netz, der bisher problemlos Funktioniert hat, seit der vom netz ist bekomme ich weider normale IP adressen\n<testdr> waldemar: etwas genauer bitte, ein WLAN-Repeater .. f\u00c3\u00bcr gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fere Distanz .. und dann w\u00c3\u00a4re interessant welcher Typ und wie konfiguriert ...\n<waldemar> Sekunde, ich such den link dazu raus\n<waldemar> testdr: es dreht sich um dieses Ger\u00c3\u00a4t: http://www.teltarif.de/medion-life-p85016-schnaeppchen-wlan-repeater-aldi/news/55524.html\n<testdr> waldemar: na ja -- das ding kann auch access-point sein und dann ist da ein dhcp-server vorhanden, fragt sich nur ob aktiv .. oder ob der versucht die Funktion des haupt-dhcp-servers (vom Zugangsrouter) nur weiter zu geben ...\n<waldemar> testdr: momentan ist der Schalter auf \"Client\" gestellt. \n<waldemar> Keine ahnung, vielleicht durch irgend einen Fehler oder sonst was hat er den DHCP angeschmissen ?!? \n<testdr> waldemar: .. also nicht als \"repeater\" .. laut beschreibung sind es 3 Einstellungen\n<waldemar> genau, als client mit einem LAN Kabel zu einem anderen Rechner\n<waldemar> Sorry, bin hier nur zu besuch, ist leider nicht mein Netzwerk\n<testdr> waldemar: dann tippe ich darauf, dass der dhcp-server aktiv ist denn der muss f\u00c3\u00bcr das Sub-WLAN-Netz die ip vergeben und die route \u00c3\u00bcber sich selbst angeben ..\n<waldemar> Auch als client?\n<testdr> waldemar: wie sollen denn die WLAN-clients, die sich an dem client verbinden diese Einstellungen bekommen?\n<waldemar> Ich dachte, wenn er als Client im Netz ist, dann fungiert er quasi als WLAN-Karte, so dass sich ein anderer Rechner per LAN Kabel verbinden kann\n<spycrab0> Ich habe neuerdings GNOME 3 installiert und nun sind unter Unity meine Desktop Icons verschwunden. \"nautilus -q\" hat auch nicht geholfen. Verwende Ubuntu 14.04. Hat irgendjemand ne Idee wie man das fixen k\u00c3\u00b6nnte?\n<testdr> waldemar: laut beschreibung wird \u00c3\u00bcber das netzwerkabel nicht ein weiterer client angeschlossen, sondern das ist die verbindung zum router ... -- wenn man ein langes kabel legt ..\n<waldemar> testdr: Ich werde dem in 2 Wochen mal auf den Grund gehen, ich habe leider gerade sehr gro\u00c3\u009fen Zeitdruck. Vielen Dank f\u00c3\u00bcr deine Unterst\u00c3\u00bctzung\n<testdr> spycrab0: was waren denn das f\u00c3\u00bcr desktop-icons?  Die sind von windowmanager zu anderem wm nicht so einfach zu \u00c3\u00bcbernehmen .. --- liegen sie denn noch im Verzeichnis Desktop?\n<spycrab0> Ja, sind noch da.\n<spycrab0> Werden auch alle noch  in Nautilus angezeigt.\n<testdr> spycrab0: pr\u00c3\u00bcfe doch mal ob sich der benutzte Verzeichnisname ge\u00c3\u00a4ndert hat .. d.h. vielleicht wird seit der gnome-Nachinstallation nicht mehr \"Desktop\" genommen, sondern z.B. Schreibtisch .. oder \u00c3\u00a4hnliches ..\n<spycrab0> Der Verzeichnisname ist immernoch \"Schreibtisch\". Ein Desktopverzeichnis gibt es nicht.\n<testdr> spycrab0: ich hab grade kein 14.04 mit Unity laufen -- aber der Mist mit den Verzeichnisnamen ist makaber, bei mir nennnt sich das ding \"Arbeitsfl\u00c3\u00a4che\" also mit Umlaut ...\n<testdr> spycrab0: hast Du denn schon versucht ein neues icon(Starter) anzulegen und wo wird der abgelegt?\n<spycrab0> Bekomm erst gar kein Dropdown-Men\u00c3\u00bc wenn ich versuche auf dem Desktop ein Icon anzulegen\n<testdr> spycrab0: da ist nichts mit dropdown, sieh mal hier: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Unity\n<spycrab0> Ich meine das Dropdown-Men\u00c3\u00bc das sich normalerweise \u00c3\u00b6ffnet wenn man einen Rechtsklick auf eine leere Stelle am Desktop ausf\u00c3\u00bchrt.\n<testdr> spycrab0: hast du den link gelesen wie unter unity ab ubuntu-13.04 ein icon(Programmstarter) auf dem Desktop angelegt wird?\n<spycrab0> Ja, funktioniert nur leider auch nicht :/\n<OERIAS> ?join #ubuntu-uk\n<testdr> spycrab0: warum hast du gnome3 installiert?

Der Server ist down. Ich w\u00c3\u00bcrde das gerne nutzen. Es basiert afair auf grive, die site ist aber seit l\u00c3\u00a4ngerem down.Nun sehe ich, dass eine Canadische Firma syncdrive.com launchen will. Dort ist aber ausser ein 30% bar nichts zu finden. Ich habe bei einer google-suche bisher nur OpenText gefunden https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/opentext-announces-free-enterprise-file-130000888.html Das schein\n<Gerhard> t aber auch etwas anderes zu sein. \n<Haraldo> Guten Morgen. Xubuntu 14.04, seit gestern geht der Bildschirm nach einer Zeit auf \"blank screen\". In den Einstellungen ver\u00c3\u00a4nderte ich nichts, Updates liefen da auch nicht. Wo kann ich mit der Suche ansetzen?\n<Haraldo> Energieeinstellungen Monitor schaute ich schon, da ist alles beim alten.\n<testdr> Haraldo: Xubuntu? .. also wohl xfce .. das sind die Einstellungen von dem ..\n<Haraldo> testdr, dieser light-locker.\n<testdr> Haraldo: ja - k\u00c3\u00b6nnte sein, so weit ich wei\u00c3\u009f nimmt Xubuntu den als \"screensaver\" w\u00c3\u00a4hrend Lubuntu zum alten screensaver gewechselt hat\n<Haraldo> testdr, ich finde den nicht unter Einstellungen. Da ist eh noch ein Gemisch aus deutscher und englischer Beschriftung.\n<Haraldo> Merkw\u00c3\u00bcrdig ist nur, dass es erst seit gestern so ist, ohne willk\u00c3\u00bcrlich durchgef\u00c3\u00bchrte Ver\u00c3\u00a4nderung.\n<testdr> Haraldo:  schau mal da( bekannt?): http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Bildschirmschoner#Xfce\n<Haraldo> testdr, danke, alles durchgeschaut gestern, ich finde nur den dort angegebenen Pfad bei mir nicht unter Einstellungen.\n<testdr> Haraldo: das ist scheinbar kein Schalter mehr f\u00c3\u00bcr an/aus, sondern Schieberegler f\u00c3\u00bcr die Dauer\n<Haraldo> testdr, den finde ich nicht mal mehr.\n<testdr> Haraldo: ich das zur Zeit nicht laufen und kann nicht nachsehen -- hast Du mal in einem Terminal probiert \"light\" einzutippen und dann 2x die Tabulator-Taste .. ob das Ding \"light-locker\" sich nennt und dann aus dem Terminal zu starten?\n<Haraldo> testdr, dass kann es fast schon sein, light-locker nicht vorhanden. Aber warum \u00c3\u00a4nderte sich da was gestern ohne mein Zutun? Dann werde ich den Light-locker mal rasch installieren.\n<testdr> Haraldo: willst Du wirklich darauf eine Antwort? .. es gibt Leute, die glauben Computer machen die gew\u00c3\u00bcnschten Dinge automatisch ..\n<Haraldo> testdr, hmm ja, die gibt es und ich weiss auch, dass dem nicht so ist. Aber wenn man nicht in den Einstellungen war und gestern auch kein Update lief, kommt man dennoch ins gr\u00c3\u00bcbeln.\n<testdr> Haraldo: wenn der nicht installiert ist ... dann k\u00c3\u00b6nnte noch mehr fehlen. Hast Du die Erst-Installation ohne Internetverbindung gemacht?\n<Haraldo> testdr, die mache ich immer mit aktiver LAN-Verbindung.\n<testdr> Haraldo: bei meiner letzten 14.04 Xubuntu Installation hatte der nicht gefehlt ...\n<Haraldo> testdr, merkw\u00c3\u00bcrdig.\n<testdr> Haraldo: ich fand ja schon Deinen Hinweis - von wegen noch so viel in Englisch, merkw\u00c3\u00bcrdig ...\n<Haraldo> testdr, Beispiel Screenshot, da ist es noch auf englisch.\n<Haraldo> Der light-locker erscheint nun unter Einstellungen und ist auch auf englisch.\n<testdr> Haraldo: da kann ich Dir nicht weiterhelfen - wie gesagt hab ich zur zeit kein Xubuntu-14.04 laufen ..\n<Haraldo> testdr, danke Dir dennoch.\n<testdr> Haraldo: wenn Du synaptic nutzt zur Installation von Paketen, dann schau mal nach was an Sprachpaketen verf\u00c3\u00bcgbar ist .. f\u00c3\u00bcr xfce, vielleicht fehlt da nur die Installation\n<Haraldo> testdr, ah danke! Das schaue ich mal nach.\n<Haraldo> testdr, Treffer, er meldete sofort, dass es unvollst\u00c3\u00a4ndig sei. Vielen Dank, dann ist das gel\u00c3\u00b6st.\n<testdr> Haraldo: hast Du erst vor wenigen Tagen installiert? Als diverse Server etwas \u00c3\u00bcberlastet waren und noch wg. dem Upgrade sind?\n<Haraldo> testdr, ich installierte, als die 14.04 frisch erschien, nur wenige Tage nach Erscheinen.\n<testdr> Haraldo: das ist aber schon .. Monate her ... und seit dem ... ist das unvollst\u00c3\u00a4ndig?\n<Haraldo> testdr, ja genau. Fiel mir nicht auf und ist mitunter schlicht gemischt in manchen Men\u00c3\u00bcs.\n<testdr> Haraldo: ich hab mal bei der LUbuntu-14.04 nachgesehen - da erscheint bei mir der light-locker-settings auch mit englischer Beschriftung\n<Haraldo> testdr, danke f\u00c3\u00bcr die Info. Der Screenshot ist bei mir zus\u00c3\u00a4tzlich auf englisch.

(netspeed-applet2 hei\u00c3\u009ft das applet)\n<dreamon> Aber scheint ein anders Problem zu sein, weil auch die \"System\u00c3\u00bcberwachung\" mir einen Netzwerktraffic von 0 anzeigt.. sehr verd\u00c3\u00a4chtig\n<nagetier> dreamon, dann muss man herausbekommen, von welcher Quelle die Tools ihre Daten beziehen und dort ggf. ansetzen\n<jokrebel> dreamon: Ich seh da grad, dass das wohl nicht aus den Ubuntuquellen zu stammen scheint\n<Rochvellon> ich habe probleme mit wechseldatentr\u00c3\u00a4gern. werfe ich bspw. eine cd mit dem hardwareschalter aus, so wird die cd weiterhin als eingeh\u00c3\u00a4ngt angezeigt. in gnome-disks? wird weiterhin ein geisteintrag von meiner usb-platte angezeigt, den ich selbst bei eingeh\u00c3\u00a4ngtem laufwerk nicht bearbeiten kann, wobei dann ein 2. eintrag dort vorhanden ist, der normal bearbeitet werden kann. any ideas to fix it? 14.04\n<dreamon> jokrebel, den hab ich auch versucht, zeigt auch nur 0 an.\n<jokrebel> dreamon: Wen hast Du auch versucht?\n<dreamon> jokrebel, http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Netspeed \n<jokrebel> dreamon: Die fiel unter anderem das \"war ein Applet\" in der Einleitung nicht auf?\n<dreamon> jokrebel, Wie hie\u00c3\u009f dein tool nochmal \"corkney\" oder so \u00c3\u00a4hnich?\n<jokrebel> conky, ist ein Tool f\u00c3\u00bcr den Desktophintergrund \n<jokrebel> Dir\n<dreamon> jokrebel, Das ist ein alternatives applet, (ich h\u00c3\u00a4tte es gern im Panel) falls mein altes nicht mehr geht.

Mit dem hab ich das Audio einfacher gepaired\n<Guest94657> okay ich such mal\n<Anf> Guten Tag, hab mal eine kleine frage, ich hab auf meiner HDD drei Betriebssysteme installiert, Win7 Ubuntu und Debian. jetzt m\u00c3\u00b6chte ich Debian Deinstallieren, da ich Platz brauche und Ubuntu mier besser gef\u00c3\u00a4llt, Debian war nur zu Demo. Das Problem ist aber, da ich Debian als letztes installiert habe, werden die Systeme \u00c3\u00bcber den Debian Gnub ausgew\u00c3\u00a4hlt, wen ich jetzt aber Debian deinstalliere, hab ich doch kein Gnub mehr, und dan ka\n<Anf> ausw\u00c3\u00a4hlen, wen ich den PC starte, oder?\n<dadrc> Danach einmal Ubuntu vin einer Live-CD booten und Grub von Ubuntu installieren\n<dadrc> Anf: Ist hier gut beschrieben, wie das geht: https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB_2/Reparatur#Reparatur-mittels-Desktop-CD\n<leszek> Du kannst auch direkt mal mit dem Debian Grub einfach Ubuntu booten und bei Ubuntu einfach mal sudo grub-install /dev/sda eingeben vorraussetzung du willst in den mbr installieren und hast kein EFI\n<christoph_> blueman findet leider nichmal das ger\u00c3\u00a4t+\n<Anf> Super, vielen Danke. \n<leszek> christoph_: klappt bei dir das Kommando bluetoothctl ?\n<christoph_> nein\n<leszek> hmm.. schade ich dachte Ubuntu hat systemd \u00c3\u00bcbernommen. Du hast noch nen \u00c3\u00a4lteres Ubuntu ?\n<christoph_> 14.04\n<leszek> ja ok das hat das noch nicht\n<leszek> dann mal anders. Zeigt dir hcitool scan  dein bluetooth ger\u00c3\u00a4t an ?\n<leszek> pairing am bluetooth ger\u00c3\u00a4t muss laufen denke ich\n<christoph_> moment\n<christoph_> nein\n<christoph_> das scannen dauert auch erstaunlich kurz\n<christoph_> hcitool dev zeigt aber eine adresse an womit er das bluetooth modul zumindest kennen sollte\n<christoph_> und die gui variante unter ubuntu erkennt das ger\u00c3\u00a4t auch nicht immer (erst nach einem neustart wieder)\n<leszek> christoph_: sorry ich muss jetzt weg aber probier mal das was hier unter Pairing mit Bluetooth-Agent steht: https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Bluetooth/Einrichtung\n<leszek> vorraussetzung ist aber erstmal dass das Ger\u00c3\u00a4t erkannt wird, ansonsten n\u00c3\u00bctzt alles nix\n<christoph_> und dem ist leider nicht so :D\n<christoph_> aber danke\n<Guest79953> das scheint wirklich frickel arbeit zu sein und ist der erste punkt in dem windows deutlich einfach war :D\n<Anf> Hallo\n<Anf> Ich hab soeben meine Debian Partition mit Ubuntu formatiert, wen ich den PC jetzt Neu starte, wird der Debian Gnub kein System finden, weil der Debian Gnub ja auch weg ist, wie kann ich jetzt den Ubuntu Gnub aufspielen, ohne Live CD, den ich bin jetzt ganz normal mit Ubuntu drin\n<jokrebel> Anf: Wie hast Du Ubuntu denn aufgespielt ohne Live-Medium? Bei der Installation wird normalerweise n\u00c3\u00a4mlich Grub (nicht Gnub) auch mit installiert.\n<k1l_> im wiki ist eine anleitung zu Grub 2, und wie man den repariert sowohl aus dem system als auch mit live cd/usb\n<Anf> Wie man den aus der Live CD installiert hab ich gefunden, aber wie man den mit dem System installiert, finde ich nicht\n<Anf> Habs, ich hab bei Reparatur, und nicht bei Installation geguckt, alles klar\n<Anf> Der fragt mich jetzt, welche Ger\u00c3\u00a4te f\u00c3\u00bcr den Grub installiert werden m\u00c3\u00bcssen, was meint er mit Ger\u00c3\u00a4ten?\n<Anf> Wie w\u00c3\u00a4hle ich den die Ger\u00c3\u00a4te aus, wen ich auf Enter gehe, best\u00c3\u00a4tige ich, und wie man ich die Hacken bei den Ger\u00c3\u00a4ten?\n<Anf> Ausw\u00c3\u00a4hlen geht mit Leer Taste.\n<jokrebel> Wie bekomm ich denn (aus Thunderbir-Anh\u00c3\u00a4ngen heraus) die Standard-Anwendung ver\u00c3\u00a4ndert? Beim \u00c3\u00b6ffnen eines JPG bekomme ich den Bildbetrachter vorbelegt. Ausw\u00c3\u00a4hlen k\u00c3\u00b6nnte ich noch EOG (ist das nicht das selbe?). Wenn ich \"andere\" ausw\u00c3\u00a4hle \u00c3\u00b6ffnet sich nur eine Art Dateimanager mit der Kopfzeile \"Hilfsanwendung w\u00c3\u00a4hlen\"\n<Rochvellon> die dateizuordnung bspw. \u00c3\u00bcber den dateibrowser \u00c3\u00a4ndern?\n<jokrebel> Rochvellon: Und wie ging das nochmal?\n<ppq> jokrebel, in dem dateimanager-dialog musst du in /usr/bin den pfad zur anwendung angeben. ist leider nicht so intuitiv gel\u00c3\u00b6st seitens mozilla\n<ppq> ... oder wo auch immer die ausf\u00c3\u00bchrbare datei liegt. herausfindbar mit \"which <programmname>\"\n<ppq> oder \"whereis\" statt \"which\"\n<jokrebel> ach da is Thunderbird schuld dran, dass das so bl\u00c3\u00b6d ist? Und danke /usr/bin war das was mir nicht mehr einfallen wollte\n<ppq> ja, die haben da wohl was eigenes gebastelt statt die API der desktopumgebung zu nutzen\n<ppq> w\u00c3\u00a4re wohl auch zu umst\u00c3\u00a4ndlich bei all den verschiedenen untersz\u00c3\u00bctzten plattformen\n<jokrebel> ok - prima. Jetzt kann ich es mit LibreOffice \u00c3\u00b6ffnen und dann hoffentlich nicht mehr blo\u00c3\u009f 80% auch \"erfolgreich\" ausdrucken.

Oder f\u00c3\u00bcr die SMB-Freigabe muss man zu \"Windows-Netzwerk\"\n<sash_> Wenn ich per Nautilus Netzwerkkram mounte, tu ich das explizit \u00c3\u00bcber \"Connect to server\" und tippe da dann smb://<Name> ein oder so.\n<sash_> Wenn ich Linux mounte, nutz ich meistens sshfs.\n<mgolisch> Rochvellon: wie sehen die berechtigungen von ~/.bash_history aus?\n<Rochvellon> ~/.bash_historiy 0600 und wenn ich direkt am rechner arbeite, wird die historie auch korrekt gespeichert\n<mgolisch> hast du mehrere shells offen als dieser user?\n<Rochvellon> n\u00c3\u00b6, ei. sollte nur eine verbindung offen sein\n<mgolisch> komisch\n<mgolisch> shopt|grep hist zeigt das andere werte\n<mgolisch> hatte bis jetzt eigentlich nur probleme wenn ich mehrere shells offen hatte\n<mgolisch> und wenn histappend nicht aktiviert war, dann \u00c3\u00bcberschreibt er die history das ist doof bei mehren gleichzeitigen shells\n<Rochvellon> append ist auf on\n<Kirsten> hallo Leute ich bin es noch mal. Jetzt gibt es ein kleines Problem: wenn ich jetzt einen meiner Texte vom NAS \u00c3\u00b6ffnen will, so soll ich jetzt, nachdem ich nur \u00c3\u00bcber nfs zugreife ein Passwort f\u00c3\u00bcr die Datei eingeben. das musste ich vorher nicht. Habt ihr daf\u00c3\u00bcr eine L\u00c3\u00b6sung?\n<nagetier> Kirsten, lege von einem System jetzt probeweise eine neue Datei an, greife von CLN2 darauf zu..\n<nagetier> Kirsten, funktioniert das, \u00c3\u00a4ndere die UID/GID auf der NAS f\u00c3\u00bcr diese Daten\n<Kirsten> leider geht das auch nicht. Wenn ich jetzt \u00c3\u00bcber open office eine Datei speichern will, soll ich mich authentifizieren. als Bn ist anonymous angegeben und ich kann den dann auch nicht \u00c3\u00a4ndern..\n<nagetier> Kirsten, die neue Datei liegt in einen ebenfalls neuem Ordner?\n<nagetier> *einem, einen\n<Kirsten> \u00c3\u00a4hm, nein, mach ich gleich mal\n<Kirsten> Beim Erstellen des Ordners in \u00c2\u00bbftp://server1.local/\u00c2\u00ab ist ein Fehler aufgetreten.\n<mgolisch> ?\n<mgolisch> ftp?\n<Kirsten> ok, ftp abstellen?\n<mgolisch> du hast das doch gemounted per nfs\n<mgolisch> wieso greifst du dann nicht daraueber drauf zu?\n<nagetier> einfach nicht \u00c3\u00bcber ftp anlegen.. ftpd kann sinnvoll sein\n<Kirsten> ups, jetzt wird mein nas \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt nicht mehr angezeigt..\n<Kirsten> hier l\u00c3\u00a4uft etwas m\u00c3\u00a4chtig schief...\n<Kirsten> vielleicht schalte ich einfach wieder smb ein, damit lief es ja ganz gut...\n<bekks> Vergiss einfach dieses ganze \"Angezeige\" - mounte es per NFS und gut.\n<bekks> Du brauchst weder SMB, CIFS noch FTP.\n<Rochvellon> hm, mgolisch, scheint an diesem rechner irgendwie zu liegen. gehe ich \u00c3\u00bcber android auf den fraglichen rechner, kann ich mich auch zum einen viel schneller verbinden und die historie wird korrekt gespeichert\n<Kirsten> naja, das versuche ich ja\n<bekks> Nein, du wolltest gerade wieder smb wieder einschalten...\n<Kirsten> mit nfs klappt es ja irgendwie nicht\n<bekks> Weil du das grafisch machst, und statt NFS dann FTP genutzt hast.\n<bekks> In diesem PAstebin von dir: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11950430/ sieht man schon sehr sch\u00c3\u00b6n dass du es per NFS gemounted hast/hattest.\n<kubine> bekks: Title: Ubuntu Pastebin (at paste.ubuntu.com)\n<bekks> Was genau reicht denn daran nicht?\n<Kirsten> naja, ich kann dann halt nicht per nautilus bzw.caja drauf zugreifen\n<bekks> Was genau passiert denn, wenn du dann auf /mnt/Datenplatte zugreifst?\n<nagetier> Kirsten, kannst du, wenn du mal einen Dienst nutzten w\u00c3\u00bcrdest\n<Kirsten> ah!!! so geht das!\n<bekks> Wie denn sonst???\n<nagetier> wenn du dann per ftp darauf m\u00c3\u00b6chtest, ist das dem ftpd beizubringen\n<bekks> Wozu mountest du das denn, wenn du den mount nicht nutzt?!\n<Rochvellon> ich denke, bekks, es wird darauf gewartet, dass wie bei windows ein laufwerksbuchstabe vergeben wird :)\n<Kirsten> ok, habe gerade dazu gelernt. ok, aber warum werden die Dokumente jetzt schreibgesch\u00c3\u00bctzt ge\u00c3\u00b6ffnent?\n<bekks> Rochvellon: M\u00c3\u00b6chlich.\n<bekks> Kirsten: Welche Berechtigungen hat denn so eine Beispieldatei?\n<Kirsten> Besitzer: kirsten Gruppe: users\n<Rochvellon> schreibschutz?\n<bekks> ls -lha Dateiname\n<Kirsten> in den Eigenschaften steht, dass Kirsten lesen und schreiben darf - darf sie aber nicht\n<bekks> ls -lha Dateiname\n<Kirsten> naja, aber dann m\u00c3\u00bcsste ich ja alle Dateien auf dem NAs mit ls -lha Dateiname behandeln\n<bekks> ls -lha \"behandelt\" nichts.\n<bekks> ls -lha zeigt Berechtigungen an.\n<bekks> Und, kriegen wir die Ausgabe noch?\n<Kirsten> ja, irgendwie klappt das noch nicht so\n<bekks> Was klappt nicht?\n<bekks> ls -lha Dateiname ist ein Befehl, der eine Handvoll Zeilen als Ausgabe hat.\n<Kirsten> wenn ich  ls -lha mfg5.odt eintippe, sagt er mkir, dass er die Datei nicht findet\n<Kirsten> ist aber da\n<mrkramps> Kirsten, du musst schon noch in den pfad der datei wechseln \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n<Kirsten> ja und ich bin im verzeichnis\n<mgolisch> was sagt pwd\n<mgolisch> sagt das /mnt/Datenplatte ?\n<mgolisch> oder wo auch immer diese datei liegt?\n<Kirsten> pwd zeigt mir das Verzeichnis an\n<Kirsten> ja\n<Rochvellon> gro\u00c3\u009f-/kleinschreibung beachtet?\n<Kirsten> klar\n<Kirsten> kann ich mir die Berechtigung nicht auch irgendwie anders anzeigen lassen?\n<Rochvellon> du kannst dir auch mit \"ls -lha /mnt/Datenplatte\" die berechtigungen anzeigen lassen. nur dann wird je nach belegung viele eintr\u00c3\u00a4ge generiert\n<Kirsten> ja kann ich: -rwxrwxr-x\n<bekks> Und welchen Dateinamen hast du verwendet?\n<bekks> Und existiert die Datei auch in /mnt/Datenplatte/ ?

Also bitte auf die aktuelle Version aktualisieren, dann wirst du das Problem nicht mehr haben r2000\n<ubik__> die einzige L\u00c3\u00b6sung f\u00c3\u00bcr mich mit dem Flash-Problem ist es, google chrome zu nutzen\n<ubik__> aber auch nicht gerade toll, weil ich nicht so gerne meine daten an google gebe\n<ubik__> eventuell w\u00c3\u00a4re chromium mit pepper-flash-plugin eine alternative\n<leszek> ubik__: warum denn das ? Der FlashPlayer f\u00c3\u00bcr den Firefox ist doch aktuell mit 491 und sollte da klappen. Zudem gibts freshplayer mit dem man zur Not auch das PPAPI Flashplugin von Chrome mit firefox nutzen kann\n<leszek> Also ein Google Chrome muss nicht verwendet werden um Flash abzuspielen. Ich rate davon sowieso ab sich so einen Trojaner auf den Rechner zu holen\n<ubik__> leszek: Ja, aber bei vielen Videos geht zum Beispiel Vollbild nicht richtig, wenn ich den Flashplayer f\u00c3\u00bcr Firefox nutze\n<ubik__> Beispielsweise auf dmax.de\n<ubik__> Mit Google Chrome klappt es\n<ubik__> Oder einige Buttons funktionieren nicht richtig auf einigen anderen Seiten\n<leszek> ubik__: ok ich kenne das nicht. Aber dann kannst du wie gesagt den freshplayer benutzen, der als plugin das ppapi flash von chrome nutzt\n<ubik__> probier ich mal aus\n<leszek> der adobe flashplayer hat \u00c3\u00bcbrigens den Vorteil, dass DRM geschichten laufen. Man braucht daf\u00c3\u00bcr zwar das hal Paket aber einige Webseiten rtlnow und andere Mediatheken oder Amazon Prime ben\u00c3\u00b6tigen dieses\n<ubik__> also ich habe sudo apt-get install freshplayerplugin pepperflashplugin-nonfree\n<ubik__> installiert\n<ubik__> aber auf dmax.de funktioniert vollbild einfach nicht\n<ubik__> ich kriege einen schwarzen bildschirm\n<ubik__> und nachdem ich flashplugin-installer deinstalliert habe\n<ubik__> bekomme ich einen wei\u00c3\u009fen bildschirm\n<ubik__> lol\n<ubik__> :D\n<leszek> ubik__: lass mich mal bei mir checken\n<leszek> dmex videothek ?\n<leszek> *dmax\n<ubik__> ja\n<ubik__> einfach irgendein video anklickenm\n<ubik__> -m\n<ubik__> ich habe eine intel hd 4600p\n<leszek> ok mal sehen.\n<leszek> ja schonmal besser als meine intel hd3000\n<ubik__> und ubuntu 15.04\n<ubik__> aber auch mit 14.04 war es nicht anders\n<leszek> Also l\u00c3\u00a4uft bei mir\n<leszek> Es ruckelt nur wie sau im Fenstermodus. Mach ich Vollbild wirds fl\u00c3\u00bcssig\n<ubik__> hmm\n<leszek> ubik__: rechtsklick und einstellungen. Ist dort 3D Beschleunigung oder Hardwarebeschleunigung an oder aus ?\n<ubik__> an\n<ubik__> aber auch mit aus funktioniert es nicht\n<leszek> nach ausschalten musst du aber einmal reloaden die ganze seite, sonst \u00c3\u00bcbernimmt der das nicht\n<leszek> flashplayer muss quasi einmal neustarten\n<ubik__> ok, geht aber auch nicht\n<ubik__> lol\n<ubik__> jetzt habe ich was bemerkt\n<leszek> undzwar ?\n<ubik__> ganz oben links wird das video abgespielt, aber nur im 10x10 Pixel Format\n<ubik__> :D\n<leszek> haha herrlich. Ach der Flashplayer. Jetzt wei\u00c3\u009ft du warum der so beliebt ist\n<leszek> Ja ganz seltsam\n<ubik__> Das ist der Grund, warum ich immer noch auf Google Chrome angewiesen bin\n<ubik__> W\u00c3\u00a4re das Problem mit dem Flash Player nicht, w\u00c3\u00bcrde ich Firefox benutzen.\n<leszek> Nunja wenn es partout unter Firefox nicht geht, dann nimm besser den Chromium, das ist quasi Chrome ohne Google Spionage\n<ubik__> mal ausprobieren...\n<leszek> Chrome basiert ja auf Chromium und Chromium ist das OpenSource Projekt\n<r2000> ubik__, hast du den vielleicht mal von hand installiert?\n<r2000> https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/adobe_flash#Unterschiedliche-Versionen-von-Adobe-Flash\n<ubik__> ne, hab ich nicht\n<ubik__> mit chromium geht es aber auch\n<ymb> hi\n<monir_> hallo\n<monir_> ist es m\u00c3\u00b6glich und sinnvoll Lubuntu mit Mate zu installieren?

Ist es empfehlenswert bei einem Multibootsystem Win 7 und Ubuntu(-s) je auf einer SSD zu haben und eine HD als Datengrab? Was k\u00c3\u00b6nnten Haken sein?\n<k1l_> wenn du so viele ssds hast, warum nicht :)\n<Xeno> :)\n<bekks> mgolisch: Wozu auch. :)\n<Xeno> Ich habe bessere Erfahrungen gemacht mit 1 Platte pro OS-Typ. Klar, ist Luxus.\n<k1l_> kannst auch alles auf ssds packen wenn du magst :) also ubuntu ist da relativ freiz\u00c3\u00bcgig wo man die partitionen hinpackt. sollten halt nur nicht volllaufen oder fehlen beim boot.\n<Xeno> Ja richtig, allerdings sind es \"nur\" 256 GB SSDs.\n<Xeno> Die k\u00c3\u00b6nnen schon noch mal voll werden.\n<bekks> Windows braucht hmm, 50GB, Ubuntu 20GB.\n<bekks> Da wird nix voll :)\n<bekks> Daf\u00c3\u00bcr hast du ja das Datengrab.\n<Xeno> jaja, aber da ist dann kein Office GIMP usw dabei.\n<bekks> Doch, in den 20GB ist eine full blown desktop Umgebung drin.\n<bekks> Ohne Probleme.\n<Xeno> Es ist nicht sinnvoll Anwendungen im Datenfrab zu installieren.\n<Xeno> Echt?\n<Xeno> 20 GB?\n<bekks> Echt. \n<Xeno> Cool\n<Xeno> Kann ich ja 10 Ubuntus auf die SSD knallen :)\n<bekks> Und ein Windows mit ohne Daten vollzukriegen wenn man dem Ding 50G oder 100G gibt, ist auch sau schwer.\n<Xeno> ja stimmt\n<bekks> Wenn man halt jeden Scheiss auf dem Desktop speichert reichen auch 256TB nicht.\n<k1l_> also nen reines ubuntu system auf \u00c3\u00bcber 20GB zu bekommen ist schon schwierig. das meiste frisst dann ja der user kram, so wie bilder, musik, videos etc...\n<Rochvellon> mein system ist ohne nutzerdaten rund 12 gb gro\u00c3\u009f\n<Xeno> Is es ein (grosser?) Nachteil, wenn ein solches Multibootssystem noch ein altes BIOS (also: kein UEFI) hat?\n<bekks> Nein.\n<Xeno> Ok!\n<Xeno> Ist Ubuntu 14.04 voll f\u00c3\u00a4hig SSD zu \"erkennen\" usw.? Win XP ist das n\u00c3\u00a4mlich z. B. nicht (Win XP brauche ich nicht mehr, no panic)\n<k1l_> ja, ubuntu 14.04 macht trim wenn es eine ssd erkennt\n<Xeno> ok sehr gut\n<Xeno> letzte Frage erlaubt?\n<Xeno> nachher h\u00c3\u00b6re ich auf zu labbern\n<Xeno> Gibt es schon Erfahrungen mit Multiboot Win *10* + Ubuntu 14.04?\n<mgolisch> ka hab noch nicht geupdated\n<k1l_> warum sollte das nicht klappen?\n<Xeno> Hm immerhin muss GRUB es ja erkennen\n<Xeno> v\u00c3\u00b6llig trivial muss das nicht sein\n<mgolisch> nee der bootet nur den bootloader von der windows boot partition\n<k1l_> grub ist das wesentlich offener in der beziehung als der windows bootloader. der l\u00c3\u00a4dt nur windows.\n<Xeno> ok ja schon, aber der Win 10 Bootloader ist dann einfach so identisch oder jedenfalls erkennbar?\n<mgolisch> ich glaube nicht das grub windows booten kann\n<mgolisch> er laedt einfach nur dessen bootloader\n<Xeno> Ja das ist klar, GRUB erkennt nahezu alles, was im Entferntesten ein OS sein k\u00c3\u00b6nnte\n<Xeno> Ja stimmt schon dass GRUB nur Bootlaoader von Win erkennt, v\u00c3\u00b6llig richtig, aber es ist nicht per se so, dass der Bootloader von Win 10 genau so erkennbar ist wie der von Win 7 oder 8 oder 8.1\n<Xeno> Okay, ich upgrade sowieso vorl\u00c3\u00a4ufig nicht. Ich werde es herausfinden. BB :)\n<mrkramps> es kommt dabei wohl auf die grub-version an, ob der bootloader von win 10 automatisch erkannt wird\n<mrkramps> allerdings kann man einen eintrag f\u00c3\u00bcr win 10 wohl jederzeit selber hinzuf\u00c3\u00bcgen\n<Xeno> ah ok. Ja , so k\u00c3\u00b6nnte das sein.\n<k1l_> wof\u00c3\u00bcr jetzt nochmal die ganze aufregung? :)\n<k1l_> wenn du jetzt eh nicht demn\u00c3\u00a4chst upgraden willst das win, dann ist das sp\u00c3\u00a4ter doch eh schon geregelt, dass das erkannt wird.\n<Xeno> ja ist wohl so\n<Nanobox> hallo zusammen \n<Nanobox> versuche den \n<Nanobox> deb

die ich mir \u00c3\u00bcber no-ip.com geholt habe (DNS    A)auch aufrufen. nur innerhalb meines lans l\u00c3\u00b6st er die url nicht auf. inwiefern habe ich mein DNS im LAN falsch konfiguriert. wo muss ich nacgucken und was \u00c3\u00a4ndern/neueintragen?\n<newbie|2> P.S.: im LAN  funktioniert aber nat\u00c3\u00bcrlich die IP adresse also https://192.168.2.191\n<nils_2> dann ist doch alles gut.

uefi dualboot von windows und ubuntu auf einer gpt ssd\n<trohn_javolta> gibt es eine m\u00c3\u00b6glichkeit den ubuntu booteintrag in den windows boot manager zu bringen?\n<deem> nein, aber umgekehrt geht es\n<trohn_javolta> in grub habe ich windows drin, ja\n<deem> lass mich raten, windows schreibt sich selbst immer in den mbr be jedem boot?\n<deem> bei*\n<trohn_javolta> okay wollte nur fragen, da mir der windows boot manager besser gef\u00c3\u00a4llt\n<deem> achso. nein. ms ist da ein wenig eigen. du wirst wohl grub oder einen anderen bootloader deiner wahl verwenden m\u00c3\u00bcssen.\n<trohn_javolta> n\u00c3\u00b6 hab das problem nicht\n<trohn_javolta> kenn mich zu wenig aus\n<trohn_javolta> aber bei einer gpt formatierten festplatte und uefi mb gibt es keinen mbr oder??\n<trohn_javolta> daf\u00c3\u00bcr ist doch die eigene efi boot partition zust\u00c3\u00a4ndig\n<deem> keine ahnung, ob sich das dort anders nennt\n<deem> kann auch sein, dass die das nun msr oder so \u00c3\u00a4hnlich nennen, aber du wei\u00c3\u009ft ja, was gemeint ist :)\n<trohn_javolta> aha\n<trohn_javolta> dann muss ich wohl den grub etwas aufpeppen\n<trohn_javolta> windows eintrag umbenennen, da steht n\u00c3\u00a4mlich windows boot manager\n<deem> joa. kann man ja nennen, wie man m\u00c3\u00b6chte\n<trohn_javolta> und optisch k\u00c3\u00b6nnte der auch mehr hergeben =)\n<deem> kann er\n<trohn_javolta> im windows boot manager kann man die Eintr\u00c3\u00a4ge auch mit der Maus w\u00c3\u00a4hlen.\n<trohn_javolta> wei\u00c3\u009ft du ob das auch geht?\n<deem> n\u00c3\u00b6. sorry\n<deem> aber wenn du bei google mal nach \"grub2 themes\" suchst, wirst du schnell f\u00c3\u00bcndig. damit kann man den ein wenig aufpeppen\n<trohn_javolta> ok, muss ich mich schlau machen\n<deem> aber ob das unbedingt not tut, daf\u00c3\u00bcr, dass man ihn nur so kurz sieht :)\n<nagetier> ich meine schon dass man den linux eintrag in den windows bootmanager unterbringen kann, allerdings wird anschlie\u00c3\u009fend dann immer noch grub aufgerufen.. kA ob es das ist, was du suchst\n<nagetier> unter 7 mbr klappte das mit boardmitteln\n<nagetier> http://www.linux-community.de/Archiv/Tipp-der-Woche/Linux-im-Bootmanager-von-Windows-7 - k\u00c3\u00b6nnte das erledigen, habe es jetzt nicht vollst\u00c3\u00a4ndig gelesen, sieht aber von den Befehlen her brauchbar aus\n<trohn_javolta> ..glaube schon..\n<trohn_javolta> vllt. meine ich aber auch nicht den windows boot manager =D\n<trohn_javolta> dieses startmen\u00c3\u00bc eben\n<trohn_javolta> das blaue kachel m\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009fig win 8 layout\n<trohn_javolta> glaub bis win7 sieht der boot manager noch so aus wie auf dem bild im link\n<trohn_javolta> diesen: http://www.com-magazin.de/img/3/4/1/3/6/8b2a0645750e1fa2.jpeg \n<nagetier> schau mal ob sich da unter der haube etwas ge\u00c3\u00a4ndert hatte, evtl muss man das nur anpassen, prinzip bleibt aber das selbe\n<nagetier> kenne das allerdings ohne dd und grub.bin auf windows \u00c3\u00bcbertragen, es geht/ging auf durch aufruf des grub in der root partition von linux\n<nagetier> s/auf/auch/\n<trohn_javolta> auf einer gpt festplatte, uefi mb und eigener efi boot partition wirds so nicht funktioniern, denk ich mal\n<nagetier> das mag leider sein\n<trohn_javolta> bevor ich da was grob zerst\u00c3\u00b6re werd ichs lieber beim grub belassen\n<trohn_javolta> diesen als erstes starten lassen, etwas aufh\u00c3\u00bcbschen und fertig\n<trohn_javolta> bin froh, dass alles soweit passt in der konstellation mit win10 und ubuntu15.04 auf gpt ssd und uefi installation.\n<trohn_javolta> gut aber, dass ich hier herumschreib, jz f\u00c3\u00a4llt mir ein, dass es in ubuntu noch eine optimierm\u00c3\u00b6glichkeit gibt f\u00c3\u00bcr ssd's. ..mit dem trim befehl glaube ich..\n<nagetier> https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/SSD\n<Keba> Hallo :)\n<MightyBroccoli> hi\n<Keba> Ich \u00c3\u00bcberlege gerade, ob ich mal l\u00c3\u00a4nger GNOME (oder sogar Unity) testen sollte. Eigentlich bin ich fast schon zufrieden, wenn ich mir viele Arbeitsfl\u00c3\u00a4chen einrichten kann und darauf Browser, Terminals etc. \u00c3\u00b6ffnen kann (gerne ohne fette Leiste voller Icons) und das meiste mit der Tastatur erledigen kann. Das klingt vielleicht eher nach (Tiling-) WM, aber da bin ich zu faul f\u00c3\u00bcr. Aktuell nutze ich XFCE,\n<Keba> was nicht schlecht gef\u00c3\u00a4llt, aber ein paar Komfort-Sachen von der GNOME-Shell sehen nicht ganz verkehrt aus, vielleicht ist so eine moderne Umgebung ja doch was f\u00c3\u00bcr mich. Meinungen? :)\n<Keba> Soll hei\u00c3\u009fen: Lohnt sich der Versuch, auch wenn ich wenig Lust habe ewig lange einzurichten? :)\n<Keba> (Geht \u00c3\u00bcbrigens um Ubuntu 14.04)\n<MightyBroccoli> Also bei Ubuntu hab ich die Erfahrung gemacht das wenn ich die Oberfl\u00c3\u00a4che der jeweiligen Version also Xubuntu und co rauswerfe einige Probleme mit der Integration auftreten. Beispiel und wirklich nur Beispiel Evolution und die Integration in Unity.\n<MightyBroccoli> Ansonsten kann ich dir als starker Anh\u00c3\u00a4nger der GNOME Oberfl\u00c3\u00a4che nur sagen das es sich wirklich lohnt auszuprobieren und etwas zu finden das den Anforderungen gerecht wird. Ist etwas aufwendig aber danach hat man den Stress nicht mehr :) \n<Keba> ah gut, ich w\u00c3\u00bcrde wohl nur Firefox, gnome-terminal und evince als \"typische\" Anwendungen nutzen. Da ist mir die Integration der Ubuntu-Dienste recht egal\n<MightyBroccoli> Na dann w\u00c3\u00bcrde ich als Oberfl\u00c3\u00a4che immer GNOME empfehlen die ist komplett \u00c3\u00bcber die Tastertur steuerbar und \u00c3\u00bcbersichtlich und nicht UNITY :D \n<Keba> das klingt schonmal gut :)\n<Keba> Bekomm ich eine platzsparende Leiste als diese Icon-Liste hin?

Aber in den Laufwerken wird die SD Karte angezeigt, ich kann da aber nichts bearbeiten, als manuell Einbinden geht nicht, Sie wird da nur angezeigt als Unbekannt.\n<strohalm> wie \u00c3\u00a4u\u00c3\u009fert sich das, wenn ein laufwerk eine sd karte anzeigt?\n<Anf> ?\n<strohalm> ich kann mir darunter nichts vorstellen\n<Anf> ALso die SD Karte wird gar nicht angezeigt, nur wen ich in das Tool \"Laufwerke\" gehe, wird die SD Karte dort als Unbekannt angezeigt\n<strohalm> aha. ja dann w\u00c3\u00bcrd ich ganz klassisch gucken was dmesg ausspuckt oder in der syslog steht\n<Anf> Muss ich alles was bei dmesg kommt in Past.Ubuntu einstellen, weil es ist sehr viel\n<sash_> Anf: Eher mal mit tail -f /var/log/syslog schauen, was so beim Einstecken der SD-Karte passiert.\n<Anf> ok, werde ich gleich machen. Die SD Karte wurde eben gerade erkannt, ich muss die SD Karte immer ca. 10mal ein und raus stecken, bis Ubuntu die Karte erkennt, ich wei\u00c3\u009f nicht woran es liegt, wen der Treiber nicht gingen w\u00c3\u00bcrde, w\u00c3\u00bcrde es ja immer nicht gehen, das ist voll komisch\n<sash_> Vermutlich ist sie einfach kaputt.\n<k1l_> einfach mal in dmesg gucken was da abgeht wenn du sie einsteckst. aber hardware, gerade usb-stick und sd karten, gehen schnell kaputt. damit muss man rechnne\n<Anf> Ja, das Problem ist nur, das Windows 7 und die GoPro die SD Karte ohne Probleme sofort erkenne, aber Ubuntu erst nach mehreren versuchen, das ist nur komisch, ich hab sch\u00c3\u00b6n mehrere miniSD zu SD Adaptern versucht, aber immer das gleiche\n<Anf> Jetzt wo er die SD Karte erkannt hat, werden die Daten mit 20MB/s \u00c3\u00bcbertragen, es ist eine miniSD HC Karte, schaffen die eigendlich nicht mehr als 20MB/s, oder liegt es an meinem eingebauten SD Karten Leser im PC oder dem Treiber\n<satorisanja> moin\n<satorisanja> Ich m\u00c3\u00b6chte Euch allen einen sch\u00c3\u00b6nen Sonntag wuenschen.\n<satorisanja> Wann kommt libre office 4?\n<mrkramps> ist bereits ver\u00c3\u00b6ffentlicht\n<mrkramps> satorisanja, siehe wiki-artikel https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/LibreOffice und https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/LibreOffice/Installation\n<satorisanja> danke\n<mrkramps> satorisanja, die version in den offiziellen paketquellen wird nicht erneuert, das m\u00c3\u00bcsste man also selber machen\n<satorisanja> Also manuell installieren nicht \u00c3\u00bcber Paketverwaltung?\n<mrkramps> satorisanja, im Artikel f\u00c3\u00bcr die Installation ist das beschrieben. Entweder \u00c3\u00bcber den Download der deb-Pakete oder einfacher \u00c3\u00bcber das einbinden eines PPAs\n<RedNifre> Guten Tag. Ich lese gerade das ubuntuusers.de-Tutorial zu bash scripts und frage mich, warum man eine Variable per unset loeschen sollte. Wo braucht man das?\n<RedNifre> Ist ein shell-script ausfuehren identisch dazu, den inhalt des scripts direkt in das terminal zu copypasten?\n<RedNifre> ich verstehe im tutorial auch nicht so ganz, was damit gemeint ist, dass man keinen zugriff auf PATH hat, wenn dann spaeter PATH als eine der vor-definierten variablen genannt wird. \n<sdx23> RedNifre: bitte?\n<sdx23> Unset habe ich tats\u00c3\u00a4chlich noch nie gebraucht. Das mit dem Pasten d\u00c3\u00bcrfte in den meisten F\u00c3\u00a4llen zutreffen\n<RedNifre> Ah, ich glaube ich hatte das Tutorial falsch verstanden: \"Im Shebang muss ein absoluter oder relativer Pfad angegeben werden, da die $PATH-Umgebungsvariable nicht beachtet wird.\" Damit ist wohl gemeint, dass PATH nur in der Shebang ignoriert wird, im Rest des Scripts ist PATH aber ganz normal da, richtig?\n<sdx23> Ja.\n<RedNifre> Nochmal zu unset: Wie werden denn Variablen gescopet? Sind alle Variablen nach Ende des Scripts wieder weg, oder bleiben die alle da? Ich meine, man kann ja environment variablen per script setzen, bedeutet das, dass man alle Hilfs-Variablen am Ende des Scripts mit unset aufraeumen sollte?\n<RedNifre> Im Tutorial steht auch noch, dass mir ein Schurke einen \"sudo\"-Befehl in ~/bin legen koennte, der mein Passwort klaut. Ohne Kommentar ist das nicht sonderlich hilfreich, es scheint auch komplett unabhaengig davon zu sein, dass ich gerade Shellscript-Schreiben lerne. Was will mir dieser Sicherheits-Hinweis sagen?\n<RedNifre> Oder ist die Botschaft \"Schreib keine Shell-Scripte die von anderen dazu benutzt werden koennen, beliebige Dateien in dein Home zu legen, sonst legen sie dir ein sudo in dein bin und klauen dein Passwort!\"?\n<k1l_> das ist nur als hinweis in wie weit man das ausreizen k\u00c3\u00b6nnte\n<k1l_> das heisst: f\u00c3\u00bchr nicht alles blind aus, von dem du nicht wei\u00c3\u009ft was es macht\n<sash_> RedNifre: Geh mal in dein ~/bin, mach touch sudo; chmod +x sudo und schau danach, was ein \"which sudo\" sagt.\n<sash_> Dein lokales bin im home wird meistens vor dem System-Pfad genommen.\n<sash_> RedNifre: http://fpaste.org/250713/85281801/\n<k1l_> ach fuck, kurse w\u00c3\u00a4hlen muss ich heute auch noch.\n<k1l_> \u00c3\u00a4hm, echan\n<RedNifre> Dann ist da noch ein Hinweis das scripte in /usr/local/bin am besten root gehoeren wegen sicherheit... die scripte kann jeder ausfuehren, wenn sie root gehoeren kann sie aber niemand editieren... was waere denn, wenn so ein script meinem eigenen user gehoeren wuerde? dann koennten es andere user ja trotzdem nicht editieren, richtig? besteht das sicherheitsproblem darin, dass es leichter ist, meinen normalen account zu knacken als root zu knacken?\n<sash_> Das Sicherheitsproblem besteht darin, dass du fremde Skripte nicht einfach ausf\u00c3\u00bchren und nutzen solltest.\n<sash_> Weil sie am Paketmanagement vorbei b\u00c3\u00b6se Sachen machen k\u00c3\u00b6nnen. \n<RedNifre> na, moment... wenn ich fremde scripte in /usr/local/bin lege wird es ja eher schlimmer wenn sie dann auch noch root gehoeren, oder?\n<RedNifre> Ich dachte der Hinweis bezog sich auf eigene Scripte, also eher \"ich moechte allen usern etwas zur verfuegung stellen, deswegen lege ich ein script in /usr/local/bin\"?\n<sash_> jo\n<Rochvellon> Hm, wie kann ich \"wpa_supplicant: nl80211: send_and_recv->nl_recvmsgs failed: -33\" einordnen?\n<RedNifre> \"WLAN geht nicht.\"\n<Rochvellon> ja, das ist mir auch aufgefallen, nachdem der rechner nicht mehr im netz erreichbar war :D\n<RedNifre> Meiner Erfahrung nach sind WLAN-Probleme immer extrem furchtbar und brauchen Stunden um sie zu beheben. Es ist auch jedesmal ein anderes Problem... meine dauerhafte Loesung war, beim Kauf einer neuen WLAN-Karte darauf zu achten, dass sie als Linux-Kompatibel gilt...\n<RedNifre> Wenn du Geld hast kannst du eine andere WLAN-Karte kaufen, wenn du Zeit hast kannst du stundenlang herumprobieren und wenn du weder noch hast dann kannst du dein Android-Smartphone per USB-Tethering anschliessen... Sorry falls ich etwas negativ wirke :/\n<Rochvellon> hm, k\u00c3\u00b6nnte auf ein kernel-problem hindeuten. andere berichteten, dass es nach wechsel die probleme nicht mehr da waren, wobei die eine realtek verwenden und regelm\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009fig discos haben/hatten. ich verwende jedoch hier eine intel, und der rechner l\u00c3\u00a4uft schon einige tage, ohne dass ich diesbez\u00c3\u00bcglich probleme feststellen konnte\n<garmini> Hallo zusammen. Ich br\u00c3\u00a4uchte einen Tip zur VirtualBox in dem ich Windows 7 (voll funktionsf\u00c3\u00a4hig)installiert habe. Ich m\u00c3\u00b6chte dar\u00c3\u00bcber das Garmin N\u00c3\u00bcvi updaten. Das Garmin Programm ist schon installiert und w\u00c3\u00bcrde an sich auch funktionieren. Mein Problem ist dass ich das erkannte N\u00c3\u00bcvi das am USB h\u00c3\u00a4ngt nicht durchleiten kann zur VB. Hier in meinem System wird es \u00c3\u00bcber den Ger\u00c3\u00a4teerkenner gut erkannt. Hat jemand ne Ahnung wie ic\n<garmini> \u00c3\u009cber die Filterfunktion (bei USB in der VB) wird das dingens leider auch nicht erkannt, Grund:? \n<garmini> \u00c3\u00bcber einen guten Tip w\u00c3\u00a4re ich echt dankbar.\n<sash_> garmini: Falls das von deinem Linux gemountet wird, kannst du das nicht weiter durchreichen.\n<sash_> Du musst das also erst unmounten (Das geht \u00c3\u00bcber den Fileexplorer) und dann mal gucken, ob du das da unten rechts bei der vbox durchleiten kannst.\n<garmini> achso. ich hab immer extra geschaut dass das eingebunden ist.\n<garmini> wenn ich den \"sicher zum entfernen\" raushaue m\u00c3\u00bcsste das gehen?\n<garmini> ich m\u00c3\u00bcsste das \u00c3\u00bcber die Filterfunktion beim USB Konfigurationsbereich in der Vbox machen. Dort wird das ja nicht erkannt. Wie unmounte ich denn dieses Garmin ger\u00c3\u00a4t eigentlch?\n<garmini> ich meine \"sicher entfernen\" und ich sehe es aber immer noch\n<sash_> Ja, ehm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Das sicher entfernen schmei\u00c3\u009ft das ganz raus, hatte ich vergessen.\n<sash_> Mit umount kannste das auf der Konsole entfernen.\n<garmini> oh weh.... :)\n<sash_> Und vielleicht musst du noch in der Gruppe vboxusers sein, daran kanns auch immer mal h\u00c3\u00a4ngen.\n<garmini> mal schaun\n<sash_> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1712447\n<garmini> danke dir\n<RedNifre> So, ich habe jetzt bash scripts einigermassen verstanden (um ein legacy projekt zu verstehen). Haben bash-scripts einen Vorteil gegenueber anderen Scripts, zum Beispiel Ruby?\n<strohalm> ja\n<RedNifre> Also, mein Verstaendnis aus dem historischen Kontext ist, dass man zu Beginn der Unix-Zeit die serioesen Programme in C und den einfachen Kleinkram in Bash geschrieben hat. Wann ist BashScript heute die richtige Wahl?\n<strohalm> bash nutzt man, weil plain sh doch n bissl anstrengend ist\n<RedNifre> naja, ich meinte warum benutzt man nicht so etwas wie Ruby oder sonstige Mainstream-Sprachen?\n<RedNifre> Vielleicht habe ich hier auch einen etwas voreingenommenen Blick, da ich Software-Entwickler bin...\n<RedNifre> ...ist BashScript eher fuer Admin gedacht, die ausser BashScripts normalerweise nichts programmieren?\n<strohalm> naja bash ist halt schon hart im mainstream. so ist es ja nicht. du hast auch ueberall ne bash oder wenigstens sh\n<strohalm> son ruby interpreter ist eher selter\n<RedNifre> Hm. Vermutlich ist es tatsaechlich nur eine Sache der Gewohnheit. Bzw. wenn man normalerweise C schreibt und jetzt ne Kleinigkeit automatisieren will ist es vermutlich einfacher, schnell bash zu lernen als ruby...\n<bekks> RedNifre: Bash ist immer dann die richtige Wahl, wenn man nicht Wochen mit der Entwickling eines Dreizeilers verschwenden will.\n<RedNifre> bekks Beispiel?\n<bekks> Automatisches Erstellen von Snapshots von virtuellen Maschinen unter Virtualbox f\u00c3\u00bcr alle User, die virtuelle Maschinen betreiben.\n<nagetier> benutzt man aus C heraus coreutils?\n<mrkramps> auja, ich schreib mir f\u00c3\u00bcr die stapelverarbeitung von bildern jetzt immer was in python\n<RedNifre> bekks, kannst du den code von deinem beispiel pasten?\n<bekks> RedNifre: Wozu, es ist doch nur ein Beispiel :)\n<RedNifre> Na, ich w\u00c3\u00bcrde gerne ein Beispiel f\u00c3\u00bcr ein Bash-Script sehen, das in Ruby wesentlich umst\u00c3\u00a4ndlicher w\u00c3\u00a4re, damit ich ein Gef\u00c3\u00bchl daf\u00c3\u00bcr bekomme, was der beste Einsatzort f\u00c3\u00bcr bash ist :)\n<bekks> Von Ruby hab ich keine Ahnung, du hast danach gefragt, warum bash toller als C ist :)\n<RedNifre> nee\n<bekks> 0802 192148 < RedNifre> Also, mein Verstaendnis aus dem historischen Kontext ist, dass man zu Beginn der Unix-Zeit die serioesen Programme in C und den einfachen Kleinkram in Bash geschrieben hat. Wann ist BashScript          heute die richtige Wahl?\n<RedNifre> Ich habe gefragt, wann bash toller als Ruby oder andere Script-Sprachen ist :)\n<bekks> Das hast du gefragt.\n<RedNifre> Genau.\n<RedNifre> Okay, am besten klarifiziere ich das.\n<bekks> Genau. Du hast gefragt, warum Bash toller als C ist. Ist deiner Frage taucht nur C und bash auf.\n<RedNifre> Ich habe es so verstanden, dass man FR\u00c3\u009cHER die seri\u00c3\u00b6sen gro\u00c3\u009fen Dinge in C und die kleinen einfachen in bash geschrieben hat. Heute gibt es aber viele neuere Programmiersprachen so dass man zum Beispiel die gro\u00c3\u009fen Dinge in Erlang und die kleinen in Ruby schreiben kann... deswegen ist meine Frage eher, ob bash einen handfesten Vorteil gegen\u00c3\u00bcber anderen Script-Sprachen hat, oder ob es eher so ist wie mit C, was ja keinen inh\u00c3\u00a4renten Vorteil gegen\u00c3\u00bcb\n<RedNifre> er anderen seri\u00c3\u00b6sen Sprachen hat. So ungef\u00c3\u00a4hr...\n<bekks> Bash hat den handfesten Vorteil fast \u00c3\u00bcberall verf\u00c3\u00bcgbar zu sein.\n<RedNifre> Gibt es f\u00c3\u00bcr dich eine Obergrenze wie komplex ein Bash-Script werden darf?\n<bekks> Nein.\n<RedNifre> Du w\u00c3\u00bcrdest also komplette Applikations-Server in bash schreiben?\n<bekks> Die allermeisten Scripte schreibt man nicht komplett an einem St\u00c3\u00bcck, sondern sie entwickeln sich. So wie jede andere Software auch.\n<bekks> Ich habe bisher noch nie einen Applikationsserver in bash gesehen.\n<RedNifre> okay, danke f\u00c3\u00bcr die Einsichten.\n<satorisanja> moin\n<sonotos> bekks: vermutlich hat selbst das schon einer versucht\n<bekks> sonotos: Wahrscheinlich :)\n<Xeno> Jemand Zeit f\u00c3\u00bcr Anf\u00c3\u00a4ngerberatung f\u00c3\u00bcr Netzwerkproblemchen? So oder so schon danke.\n<_moep_> schmei\u00c3\u009f doch mal in den raum, was nicht geht\n<Xeno> Okey mit Gefahr der Blamage\n<Xeno> Also ich m\u00c3\u00b6chte (nur) von einem Ubuntu-PC auf einen Win7-pC zu greifen\n<_moep_> mit?\n<Xeno> Die Rechner sind mit Ethernet verbunden und erkennen einander gruns\u00c3\u00a4tzlich.\n<_moep_> also welchem protokoll/welcher einsatzzweck\n<Xeno> Nur Dateaustausch\n<Xeno> Lese / Schreibzugriff\n<_moep_> dann instappier winscp auf deinem windows rechner\n<_moep_> *installier\n<_moep_> und openssh auf deinem linuxrechner\n<Xeno> Okay! Schon mal danke. Ist es nicht etwas mit Kano9nen auf Spatzen geschossen?\n<_moep_> nein, eigentlich das einfachste\n<Xeno> Okay!!\n<_moep_> klar kannst du auch auf einem von beiden rechnern nen fileserver installieren und dann mittels ftp-client daten austauschen\n<_moep_> aber das einrichten ist aufw\u00c3\u00a4ndiger, als bei nem openssh server\n<mrkramps> was denn, 'ne einfache windows-freigabe tuts daf\u00c3\u00bcr nicht?\n<Xeno> jo zun\u00c3\u00a4chst t\u00c3\u00a4te eis eigentlich eine windows-freigabe aber die krieg ich nicht hin\n<Xeno> openssh ist sicher war feines, aber wenn man nie (!) zuvor 2 pcs verbunden hat?\n<Xeno> ich habe jetzt das openssh-paket trotzdem mal auf den rechner geknallt, frisst ja wohl kein heu\n<_moep_> immer wenn mittels winscp drauf greifst\n<_moep_> ist es einfach\n<_moep_> ist ja alles grafisch\n<Xeno> gut ich mach jetzt winscp auf den win-rechner\n<mgolisch> oder filezilla das kann auch sftp\n<mgolisch> oder kann winscp das auch?\n<Xeno> ja kann sftp. *h\u00c3\u00bcstel* wie geht es jetzt weiter?\n<mgolisch> du verbindest dich nun mit dem ubuntu rechner?\n<Xeno> also der Win-Rechner sieht den Ubuntu-Rechner nicht (eigentlich korrekter: er sieht zumindest die ubuntuartigen Partitionen nicht)\n<mgolisch> haeh?\n<Xeno> k\u00c3\u00b6nnte hier das gewusel sein? aber in nautilus vom ubuntu-rechner ist der win-rechner schon sichtbar\n<Xeno> ist wie ich sagte, muss ich was konfigurieren?\n<mgolisch> das mit dem winscp wird dir aber nichts bringen wenn du vom ubuntu rechner auf den windows rechner zufgreifen willst\n<mgolisch> das w\u00c3\u00a4r ja nur andersherum\n<mgolisch> ich wuerde einfach auf dem windows rechner eine freigabe erstellen\n<mgolisch> dann kannst du die einfach in nautilus \u00c3\u00b6ffnen\n<Xeno> ja diese Freigabe gibt es ja schon. ABER: Ich kann auf nichts Sinnvolles zugreifen!\n<dreamon> Guten Abend. Versuche mit openshot oder kdenlive eine Video zu schneiden. Geht eigentlich ganz gut. Jedoch hab ich ein problem. M\u00c3\u00b6chte ab einer bestimmten Position das Video langsamer abspielen. Aber wenn ich das entsprechend einstelle, bekomme ich nur noch fragmente in  den ersten sekunden angezeigt. jemand eine Idee?\n<Xeno> Ja richtig, es geht im Moment um Zugriff von Ubuntu nach Windows.\n<mgolisch> was passiert denn wenn du auf den rechner gehts in nautilus?\n<Xeno> Dann geht noch alles gut: Es erscheinen (unter Windows) frei gegebene Verzeichnisse. Aber die kann ich leider nicht \u00c3\u00b6ffnen.\n<Xeno> Ich h\u00c3\u00a4tte keine Berechtigung zum Einh\u00c3\u00a4ngen, sagt Nautilus.\n<Xeno> Bei ADMIN$ will er zudem einen Benutzername und ein Passwort. Die von den Systemen gehen aber nicht Andere habe ich nie vergeben.\n<mrkramps> dreamon, k\u00c3\u00b6nnte man damit nicht besser direkt in einen channel f\u00c3\u00bcr die jeweiligen programm gehen?\n<mrkramps> dreamon, also zumindest sp\u00c3\u00a4testens dann, wenn hier keiner wei\u00c3\u009f, wie er dir helfen kann =D\n<mrkramps> Xeno, normalerweise d\u00c3\u00bcrfte die freigabe benutzernamen und passwort des windowsbenutzers ben\u00c3\u00b6tigen\n<mrkramps> oder eben gar keine\n<dreamon> mrkramps, Die Channels sind alle mehr als schweigsam. :(\n<mrkramps> dreamon, hatte ich bef\u00c3\u00bcrchtet :/\n<mrkramps> dreamon, vielleicht einfach den abschnitt ausschneiden, exportieren und mit einer anderen software verlangsamen?\n<mrkramps> kannst den dann ja sp\u00c3\u00a4ter wieder in dein projekt einf\u00c3\u00bcgen\n<Xeno> mrkramps: Genau das hielt ich auch f\u00c3\u00bcr das weitaus Logischste. Aber es geht leider nicht. Wirklich nicht.\n<mgolisch> siehst du die freigaben denn?\n<mgolisch> und welche einstellungen hast du f\u00c3\u00bcr die vorgenommen auf dem windows rechner?\n<Xeno> Ja, ich sehe die freigegeben Verzeichnisse. Verzeichnisse, die unter Win public sind, kann ich zudem auch \u00c3\u00b6ffnen.\n<mrkramps> Xeno, aber?\n<Xeno> auf dem Windows-Rechner habe ich radikale Freigaben gesetzt (weil ja nicht ging), also Schreibzugriff f\u00c3\u00bcr whoever.\n<Xeno> @mrkramps: Aber ich kann die nicht-public nicht \u00c3\u00b6ffnen (nur aber sehen)\n<mrkramps> Xeno, hast du denn mal in die rechte f\u00c3\u00bcr die nicht \u00c3\u00b6ffentlichen freigaben geschaut?\n<Xeno> Muss am eventuell alles aufm Win-Rechner unter public stellen? Kommt mir auch recht komisch vor \n<mrkramps> nein, aber auch unter windows muss das mit den benutzern und rechten passen\n<mrkramps> Xeno, hast du zuf\u00c3\u00a4llig noch ein weiteres ger\u00c3\u00a4t mit windows, mac/ios oder android zum gegentesten?\n<Xeno> Ja, ich habe in der Not dann die ganze fragliche Win-Partition freigegeben mit Vollzugriff\n<mgolisch> wie genau hast du die freigabe eingerichtet?\n<Xeno> Ja Smartphone mit Android\n<Xeno> @mgloisch: Ich habe gar nichts (REIN nichts) kondiguriert. Ich habe nur das Ethernet-Kabel eingesteckt. Dann erkannte Ubuntu (Nautilus) schon den Rechner.\n<mrkramps> Xeno, er meint auf deinem windows system\n<mgolisch> normal sollte er beim verbinden nach nem benutzername und passwort fragen\n<mgolisch> ausser die freigaben sind irgendwie \u00c3\u00b6ffentlich oder so\n<Xeno> ah ok: Zuerst gar nichts gemacht auf Win-Rechner, dann FReigaben immer erh\u00c3\u00b6ht bis Maximum (ganze Partition Vollzugriff)\n<Xeno> hat er von sich aus nicht\n<mgolisch> hm bei mir geht das super\n<Xeno> Im bereich \"Netzwerk\" (ganz unten) von Nautilus tauchten dann einfach pl\u00c3\u00b6tzlich Sachen (der ahndere PC) auf.\n<Xeno> :( Ich habe das Gef\u00c3\u00bchl, ich sei eigentlich ganz nahe dran, aber es tut nicht.\n<mgolisch> also bei mir geht das super\n<mgolisch> ich hab auf windows die freigaben freigegeben fuer den user am windows system\n<mgolisch> nautilus fragt mich dann beim verbinden nach benutzer und passwort\n<Xeno> Hm, wie genau hast Du unter Win freigegeben? Ich im Explorer per Rechtsklick und dann so Freigabe und so. War da was falsch bei mir?\n<mgolisch> nee genau so\n<Xeno> Hmm.... Hast Du nur einzelne Ordner freigegeben, oder eine ganze Partition?\n<mgolisch> ich hab nur das freigegeben was ich brauchte\n<Xeno> Ja wollte ich ja auch so\n<Xeno> Mache das mal r\u00c3\u00bcckg\u00c3\u00a4ngig auf Freigabe nur von was ich will\n<Xeno> JUHUU geht!!\n<Xeno> fragt mich nicht warum\n<Xeno> Vermutung: Ganze Partition freigeben geht nicht\n<Xeno> vielleicht wegen Sicherheit\n<Xeno> er fragt mich aber nichts nach Passwort\n<Xeno> \u00c3\u00b6ffnet einfach\n<Xeno> schon komisch das alles \n<Xeno> @mglisch, @mrkramps: Jedenfalls herzlichen Dank!\n<zy3pD> ich habe ein riesig gro\u00c3\u009fes problem: nach der neuinstallation fiel mir auf, dass ich die keepass datei, in der alle passw\u00c3\u00b6rter lagen warum auch immer nicht gesichert hatte! jetzt kann ich nicht mehr auf meine luks verschl\u00c3\u00bcsselten festplatte zugreifen, hat jemand eine idee was ich tun kann???\n<mrkramps> tjo, denn sind die daten wohl weg\n<zy3pD> kann man versuchen per brute force passw\u00c3\u00b6rter an luks zu testen?\n<mrkramps> ist ja nicht sinn der sache, dass man mal eben so das passwort \u00c3\u00a4ndern oder aufheben kann\n<mrkramps> man kann sich - soweit ich wei\u00c3\u009f - anzahl und l\u00c3\u00a4nge der registrierten passw\u00c3\u00b6rter ausgeben lassen\n<zy3pD> kannst du mir bitte sagen wie?

Nach einem neustart wird jedoch immer noch das gateway (10.0.0.1) f\u00c3\u00bcr DNS aufl\u00c3\u00b6sungen angefragt. \n<exoplanet> (14.04 server)\n<pLaTo0n> moin\n<pLaTo0n> wie kann ich ein bash script als anderer user ausf\u00c3\u00bchren ohne passwortnachfrage?\n<pLaTo0n> angenommen ich will vom webserver aus als anderer user einen gpg-key generieren\n<dadrc> pLaTo0n: Du kannst sudo so konfigurieren, dass es f\u00c3\u00bcr bestimme User und bestimmte Befehle kein Passwort verlangt\n<dadrc> Siehe (z.B.) https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/sudo/Konfiguration/\n<pLaTo0n> der webserver (www-data) soll halt die befehle als user \"platoon\" ausf\u00c3\u00bchren\n<pLaTo0n> sodass z.B. auch die gpg keys im home von platoon landen\n<pLaTo0n> habs bisher geschafft das bash script einfach mit sudo auszuf\u00c3\u00bchren, aber dann ist root der owner von allen dateien die dabei erzeugt werden\n<dadrc> Daf\u00c3\u00bcr gibt's -u\n<pLaTo0n> jo thx dadrc, so funzt das\n<pLaTo0n> rngd muss ich vorher als root aufrufen, dann gpg --gen-key mit \"sudo -u platoon\"\n<pLaTo0n> so gehts\n<pLaTo0n> ist es sicherheitstechnisch vertretbar www-data in sudoers auf NOPASSWD:ALL zu setzen?\n<pLaTo0n> der webserver soll nicht von au\u00c3\u009fen erreichbar sein, nur im lokalen netz\n<dadrc> halte ich nicht f\u00c3\u00bcr sinnvoll\n<pLaTo0n> ich schreibe halt sowas wie ne web gui f\u00c3\u00bcr konsolenbefehle\n<koegs> was kann schon schiefgehen :)\n<pLaTo0n> quasi ein einrichtungsassistent f\u00c3\u00bcr diverse konsolenanwendungen\n<dadrc> www-data ist im Zweifelsfall der erste Nutzer, an den jemand rankommt, der die Kiste aufmacht\n<LetoThe2nd> pLaTo0n: ist in etwa so wie den hausschl\u00c3\u00bcssel direkt von aussen in die t\u00c3\u00bcr zu stecken. sollte ja nicht von aussen erreichbar sein, da ist noch das gartentor davor.\n<pLaTo0n> da brauche ich schon relativ umfangreiche rechte\n<pLaTo0n> ziel ist es halt, dass der endbenutzer nix mehr in der konsole machen muss\n<pLaTo0n> deshalb schreib ich halt php scripte, die configs ausf\u00c3\u00bcllen, konsolenbefehle ausf\u00c3\u00bchren usw.\n<LetoThe2nd> nein, dein ziel ist gerade die arbeit zu vermeiden diese rechte sauber rauszusuchen und festzulegen.\n<pLaTo0n> naja deshalb frag ich ja :)\n<LetoThe2nd> kurzform: schlechte idee.\n<pLaTo0n> NOPASSWD:/pfad/zum/bashcript reicht anscheinend nicht\n<LetoThe2nd> vor allem ists mal wieder das rad neu erfunden. es gibt puppet, es gibt chef, etc.\n<LetoThe2nd> riehct f\u00c3\u00bcr mich danach als ob du eigentlich nur ein lokales frontend daf\u00c3\u00bcr brauchst.\n<pLaTo0n> genau\n<LetoThe2nd> und die haben das mit der rechteverwaltung n\u00c3\u00a4mlich schon drauf, und f\u00c3\u00bcr die meisten sachen auch schon gepr\u00c3\u00bcfte skripte, die nicht zum 100.000sten mal wieder unsanitized user input et.c. durchlassen\n<pLaTo0n> na das klingt doch gut\n<pLaTo0n> werde ich mir mal anschauen :)\n<pLaTo0n> dann k\u00c3\u00b6nnte ich die ben\u00c3\u00b6tigten infos per php script in ein chef recipe reinschreiben und dann ausf\u00c3\u00bchren\n<pLaTo0n> hm\n<pLaTo0n> thx LetoThe2nd, an sowas hab ich gar nicht gedacht :D\n<LetoThe2nd> pLaTo0n: immer dran denken, rad enu erfinden ist nicht gut.\n<pLaTo0n> jo auf jeden fall\n<pLaTo0n> hab nicht dran gedacht dass es sowas vielleicht schon geben k\u00c3\u00b6nnte :D\n<NTQ> Ich hab hier noch ein Ubuntu Lucid, bei dem die Paketquellen nicht mehr verf\u00c3\u00bcgbar sind. Gibt es vielleicht noch andere Quellen, von denen man noch was installieren kann?\n<k1l_> NTQ: ist das dein ernst?\n<NTQ> Ja\n<k1l_> ubuntu 10.04 bekommt selbst f\u00c3\u00bcr die server variante seit april 2015 gar keine updates mehr. die desktop teile schon seit 2013 nicht mehr. und du willst den ranz echt noch am internet betreiben?\n<NTQ> Das Ding l\u00c3\u00a4uft produktiv als Server, der seit zwei Jahren nicht mehr neugestartet wurde. Und nun ist im RAID eine Platte defekt und ich muss die Seriennummer herausfinden. Leider kann ich die smartmontools nicht installieren, weil die Quellen nicht mehr existieren. Und bevor ich das selbst kompiliere oder ein passendes Deb-Paket suche, dachte ich, es g\u00c3\u00a4be noch Quellen.\n<NTQ> Und ich kann an dem Zustand sonst gerade nicht viel \u00c3\u00a4ndern.\n<k1l_> sieh das als chance das ding auf ein aktuelles lts ubuntu hochzuziehen. dann hast du wieder f\u00c3\u00bcr 5 jahre ruhe\n<k1l_> wenn die kiste dann als spamschleuder fungiert und eure daten \u00c3\u00b6ffentlich im internet zu finden sind, dann sind wieder alle ganz traurig und keiner wei\u00c3\u009f wie das passieren konnte, ne?\n<NTQ> Ja, ich teile deine Bedenken und Vorschl\u00c3\u00a4ge, nur hab ich hier nicht das sagen. ;) Vorrangig soll erstmal die Seriennummer der Platte ermittelt werden.\n<stevieh> http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/\n<k1l_> NTQ: sorry, aber das ist unverantwortlich und einfach dumm.\n<stevieh> http://askubuntu.com/questions/91815/how-to-install-software-or-upgrade-from-an-old-unsupported-release\n<NTQ> Danke, stevieh. So kann ich wenigstens schon mal die Platte retten lassen. :)\n<musca> NTQ: Jeder user ist root auf dem Server: CVE-2016-0728\n<NTQ> musca: Danke\n<musca> NTQ: ach, was rede ich von lokalen Usern, jeder auf der Welt: remote code execution vulnerability in glibc CVE-2015-7547\n<NTQ> Noch besser :)\n<NTQ> Ich will den Server auch weg haben\n<stevieh> klar, aber konstruktiv muss man doch auch erstmal sein, nicht wahr, k1l_?\n<k1l_> ich bekomme genug spam von solchen kisten und botnetzwerken, dass ich da nicht konstruktiv sein kann.\n<stevieh> tja nun\n<nagetier> NTQ: 'sudo lshw -class disk | egrep \"(logical|serial|disk)\"' soll ebenfalls die Nummer ausgeben .. hier am lokalen System allerdings nicht\n<NTQ> nagetier: Cool, damit ging es auch.\n<NTQ> k1l_: Wenn's dich beruhigt: Der Server schickt keine Mails. Er kann es nicht mal. Das m\u00c3\u00bcsste man erstmal postfix oder sowas installieren. Aber gut, wenn jemand root wird, dann schafft er viel.\n<k1l_> NTQ: ja. ihr habt da nicht mehr alleine die kontrolle \u00c3\u00bcber den server. wie bereits gezeigt gibt es mehrere sicherheitsl\u00c3\u00bccken, die auf dme system nicht mehr gefixt werden.\n<k1l_> und f\u00c3\u00bcr die sicherheitsl\u00c3\u00bccken gibt es nat\u00c3\u00bcrlich bekannte anleitungen.\n<stevieh> und wenn das ein firmeninterner server ist?\n<NTQ> k1l_: Ich wei\u00c3\u009f. Nur weil bisher nichts passiert ist, muss das nicht so bleiben. Und deswegen werde ich anregen schon bald zu migrieren.\n<NTQ> Ich werde euch jetzt sicherlich nicht jede Kleinigkeit \u00c3\u00bcber den Server erz\u00c3\u00a4hlen. :D\n<stevieh> aha, also nicht firmenintern ;-)\n<NTQ> Ich wollte darauf hinaus, dass ihr nicht noch mehr Fragen stellen braucht. \n<stevieh> alles gut.\n<NTQ> Da wir grad schon \u00c3\u00bcber Server reden. Wie macht ihr Backups? Ich nutze momentan verschiedene Ans\u00c3\u00a4tze bei externen und internen Servern. Einmal BackupPC und einmal duplicity bzw. duply. Bei virtuellen werden Snapshots gemacht. Habt ihr Vorlieben?\n<stevieh> duplicity find ich sehr schick. \n<PJFry> Hi, ich hab ein Problem und zwar kann ich keine Softwareupdates machen, weil abh\u00c3\u00a4ngigkeiten nicht erf\u00c3\u00bcllt sind, wenn ich aber apt-get -f mache bricht der immer ab, mit dem Kommentar meine Festplatte sei zu voll.\n<stevieh> und wo sollen wir dir da helfen?\n<PJFry> jetzt ist die Frage wie kriege ich die leer genug oder warum reichen ihm die 360 mb die ich noch habe nicht aus\n<PJFry> ich habe f\u00c3\u00bcr den home ordner eine sepereate partition\n<PJFry> sprich da l\u00c3\u00b6schen nutzt nix\n<stevieh> logs? Caches?\n<PJFry> wo wie?\n<PJFry> was?\n<PJFry> <- Dau\n<stevieh> google\n<Frickelpit> sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get autoremove, danach nochmal den Speicherplatz \u00c3\u00bcberpr\u00c3\u00bcfen.\n<stevieh> geht das, wenn es nicht durchgelaufen ist?\n<PJFry> nein\n<k1l_> PJFry: lass mal \"sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade\" in einem terminal laufen und lad den gesamten output dann bei paste.ubuntu.com hoch\n<PJFry> ich hab bei systempflege bei ubuntuusers noch ein paar sachen gefunden, grade l\u00c3\u00a4uft nochmal n upgrade gucken obs durchl\u00c3\u00a4uft\n<PJFry> ich hab 15gb als systempartition, das sollte doch eig reichen oder nicht?\n<k1l_> ja\n<k1l_> aber die ausgaben im terminal sind da schon sehr genau was schief l\u00c3\u00a4uft. dann muss man weniger raten :)\n<PJFry> wie gesagt l\u00c3\u00a4uft grad\n<PJFry> k1l_ ist durchgelaufen\n<PJFry> nichts desto trotz, ist es doch erstaunlich warum ich nur noch so wenig speicherplatz habe\n<k1l_> zeig mal ein \"df -h\" und \"df -i\" in einem pastebin\n<musca> ncdu verschafft dir auch in einer Textkonsole den \u00c3\u009cberblick\n<PJFry> http://paste.ubuntu.com/21742739/\n<PJFry> http://paste.ubuntu.com/21742784/\n<stevieh> ncdu ist f\u00c3\u00bcr sowas sehr hilfreich\n<k1l_> deine inodes sind weg. du hast da viel zu viele kleine dateien auf der / partition\n<musca> hammer\n<PJFry> und das sagt mir was?\n<k1l_> mach mal ein \"dpkg -l | grep linux-headers| nc termbin.com 9999\"\n<k1l_> wenn die inodes der partition verbraucht sind, dann ist die platte voll, obwohl noch GB frei sind. inodes sind karteieintr\u00c3\u00a4ge, wo welche datei genau liegt. bei zu viele kleinen dateien sind die schneller weg als die GB der platte.\n<PJFry> http://termbin.com/w8ij\n<k1l_> genau, das ist der klassiker: noch von jedem kernel die alten header files da. das heisst unz\u00c3\u00a4hlig kleine dateien\n<Frickelpit> nette Sammlung\n<PJFry> und warum verschwinden die unloyalen geier einfach?\n<k1l_> mach mal bitte noch ein \"dpkg -l | grep linux-image| nc termbin.com 9999\"\n<stevieh> :-)\n<PJFry> http://termbin.com/qm56\n<musca> PJFry: inodes hei\u00c3\u009fen die Datenbl\u00c3\u00b6cke, die f\u00c3\u00bcr die Verwaltungsstrukturen des Dateisystems benutzt werden. Die werden beim Formatieren in einer bestimmten Anzahl reserviert.\n<stevieh> es gibt ein paket namens \"bikeshed\", da gibts ein Script namens \"purge-old-kernels\"\n<k1l_> PJFry: ok, es gibt da einen \"einzeiler\" der sucht alle kernel und header und schmeisst die dnan vom system. das dauert was aber dann sind nur noch die aktuellsten \u00c3\u00bcbrig.\n<k1l_> \"echo $(dpkg --list | grep linux-image | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort -V | sed -n '/'`uname -r`'/q;p') $(dpkg --list | grep linux-headers | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort -V | sed -n '/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\([0-9.-]*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/q;p') | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\"\n<stevieh> oder so\n<k1l_> danach dann sicherheitshalber noch ein \"sudo apt install linux-generic\" das ist das metapaket was immer zum aktuellen kernel und headers zeigt. dann passt erstmal alles\n<PJFry> warum sammeln die sich denn so?\n<stevieh> weil die nicht automatisch entfernt werden\n<k1l_> PJFry: weil die mit jedem kernel update neu dazu kommen und damals noch nicht automatisch entfernt wurden.\n<k1l_> das sollte seit diesem jahr aber eigentlich auch bei 14.04 automatisch bei neuen kernel updates passieren\n<PJFry> naja der Fehler ist schon stein alt, hab mich nur nicht gek\u00c3\u00bcmmert\n<PJFry> danke f\u00c3\u00bcr die hilfe\n<PJFry> 9,5 gb\n<k1l_> jo, da war mal ein fr\u00c3\u00bchjahrsputz f\u00c3\u00a4llig\n<NTQ> Ich hab auch mal so ein Skript geschrieben: https://freakscorner.de/quellcodes/skripte-fur-linux/alteste-kernels-loschen-deinstallieren/\n<NTQ> Mir ist vor kurzem aufgefallen, dass ich zwar Kernel 3.13-0-92 installiert habe, allerdings nur 3.13.0-24 in Grub aufgelistet und als Standard benutzt wird. Ich hab Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS installiert. Normalerweise muss ich den Kernel doch nicht selbst in grub.cfg einf\u00c3\u00bcgen. Oder doch?\n<k1l_> zeig mal ein \"ls -al /boot\" in einem pastebin\n<NTQ> k1l_: http://paste.ubuntu.com/21763967/\n<k1l_> in deinem /boot ist nur der 24er\n<NTQ> Hm. ich hab vermutlich nur die Header installiert und nicht das Image\n<k1l_> linux-image-generic installieren\n<k1l_> quatsch\n<k1l_> linux-generic\n<NTQ> Kann das auch was mit dem LTS Enablement Stack zu tun haben? Vielleicht ist der nicht installiert oder sowas.\n<k1l_> 3.13 auf nem 14.04 ist kein enablement stack\n<NTQ> linux-generic hat wohl geholfen. Er hat jetzt auch update-grub aufrufen w\u00c3\u00a4hrend apt-get\n<NTQ> Mit Enablement Stack h\u00c3\u00a4tte ich vermutlich Kernel 4.2 bzw. ab August auch 4.4, oder verstehe ich das falsch?\n<k1l_> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack#Kernel.2FSupport.A14.04.x_Ubuntu_Kernel_Support\n<NTQ> Jo\n<NTQ> Ich wei\u00c3\u009f nicht, ob ich den Enablement Stack aktivieren soll. Ich bin grad froh, dass meine Grafik halbwegs anst\u00c3\u00a4ndig l\u00c3\u00a4uft. Vielleicht macht es sie auch besser, aber das wei\u00c3\u009f man ja nie. Vielleicht teste ich es mal nach einem Clonen der Partition.\n<stevieh> so, zweiter nerviger bug in 16.04. dreck und drop im nautilus versemmelt\n<stevieh> https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2322588\n<stevieh> aha, its a feature\n<NTQ> Die machen doch st\u00c3\u00a4ndig alles schlimmer. Deswegen nutze ich auch nemo und Gnome Shell und nicht den Standard-Ubuntu-Unsinn.\n<k1l_> stevieh: das fand ich ja mega nervig :)\n<k1l_> NTQ: sch\u00c3\u00b6n das den ubuntu unsinn aber die gnome jungs verzapfen :)  \n<NTQ> Ja, wie auch immer. F\u00c3\u00bcr den DAU ist das alles Ubuntu, genau wie f\u00c3\u00bcr einige alle Smartphones iPhones sind. :D\n<Hootch1> Hi, die Nutzung von ppa's ist ja meist auf eigene Gefahr. Gibt es aber PPA's die von einer Community \u00c3\u00bcberpr\u00c3\u00bcft wurden? Hintergrund: Wenn ich ein Update von Programm xy brauche, welches noch nicht in den offiziellen Quellen ist. \n<sash_> Nein\n<sash_> Die PPAs werden von Community-Mitgliedern erstellt. Aber es gibt da keine Kontrollstrukturen. Vielleicht jeweils intern, aber das ist dann individuell unterschiedlich und freiwillig.\n<NTQ> Ich hab bei mir 28 PPAs installiert und hatte noch nie Probleme.\n<jokrebel> 28!? da hast dann wohl mehr Gl\u00c3\u00bcck als Verstand\n<NTQ> Was man halt so braucht\n<musca> und mit snap wird alles noch viel sch\u00c3\u00b6ner\n<NTQ> Ein paar der PPAs k\u00c3\u00b6nnte ich wieder raus schmei\u00c3\u009fen, aber \u00c3\u00bcber die H\u00c3\u00a4lfte brauche ich halt.\n<NTQ> Was ist snap?\n<NTQ> Ah, neues Paketformat, stimmt.\n<k1l_> Hootch1: jeder kann PPAs betreiben. es liegt an dir wieviel du den personen zutraust.\n<NTQ> Bei mir sind es haupts\u00c3\u00a4chlich die PPAs der Entwickler der Software selbst, weil ich die neuste Version brauchte. Da, wo es keine PPAs gab, wird eben selbst kompiliert.\n<Hootch1> ja selber kompilieren wird wohl werden :) und in einer VM. Vielen Dank erstmal\n<musca> NTQ: Paketformat klingt so optimistisch ... es ist ein Ubuntu-Appstore mit einem Client, der auf Biegen und Brechen auch in andere Distributionen hineingefriemelt wird (oder auch nicht).\n<k1l_> musca: das problem der abh\u00c3\u00a4ngigkeitsh\u00c3\u00b6lle haben ja mehrere projekte erkannt. gerade tobt nur der krieg, welches format sich da am schnellsten und weitesten verbreitet\n<k1l_> immerhin hat ubuntu mit den clickpackages als vorg\u00c3\u00a4nger schonmal getestet warum die anderen setups doch nicht so richtig taugen.\n<musca> k1l_:  Ja. Leider ziehen mal wieder alle an ihrem eigenen Strang.\n<stevieh> leider ist nemo aber bei diesem verhalten noch schlechter\n<stevieh> https://git.gnome.org/browse/nautilus/commit/?id=ec2b9674b0025bcd8cd30246135962d5a77d9685\n<k1l_> stevieh: seh ich \u00c3\u00a4hnlich wie die beschreibung.ich habe extra nicht mehr drag&drop genutzt wegen dem feature sondern die shortcuts. eine option zum umschlaten werden sie wohl nicht einbauen\n<stevieh> shortcuts?\n<k1l_> copy&paste\n<k1l_> odereher cut&paste\n<stevieh> ahso\n<stevieh> mir fehlt das schon ganz sch\u00c3\u00b6n... das hab ich regelm\u00c3\u00a4ssig beim wegsortieren von Dateien benutzt.\n<stevieh> und dass die Soundausgabe bei jedem Bildschirmabschalten wechselt nervt auch\n<sash_> stevieh: hdmi?\n<_Doktor_> Ich habe eben versucht vncserver zu installieren. Wenn ich den als Dienst starten m\u00c3\u00b6chte bekomme ich die Meldung: starting vncserver: vnserver.serviceFailed to start vncserver.service: Unit vncserver.service not found\n<stevieh> sash_: yep\n<_Doktor_> Kann ich mit einem VNC Server mich auch auf einen rechner remote einloggen, wenn dort keiner sitzt und die Sitzung frei gibt?\n<bekks> Wenn du VNC entsprechend konfigurierst, ja.\n<bekks> Und weil das immer sehr, sehr h\u00c3\u00a4sslich ist, nimmt man f\u00c3\u00bcr sowas lieber nxclient/nxserver.\n<_Doktor_> was ist das?\n<_Doktor_> ich finde nur nomaschinne\n<_Doktor_> Ist das freenx?\n<bekks> freenx ist die freie Implementierung dessen, was nomachine deutlich performanter anbietet.\n<_Doktor_> gibt es da auch einen client f\u00c3\u00bcr windows?\n<bekks> Von nomachine ja.\n<Amm0n> x2go w\u00c3\u00a4re da auch noch erw\u00c3\u00a4hnenswert\n<NTQ> Wie kann ich meinem Ubuntu beibringen meinen fritz repeater zu nutzen anstatt der fritz box? Beide haben die selbe SSID und Funkkanal, aber der Repeater kann hier wesentlich besser empfangen werden, da er genau zwischen fritz box und Laptop h\u00c3\u00a4ngt.

genommen\n<S4ndm4nn> schau mal rein \n<S4ndm4nn> wenn da nichts bei ist was hilfreich w\u00c3\u00a4re, lade ich den ersteh teil hoch\n<S4ndm4nn> ich hab den ersten teil nun auch hochgeladen https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/2ht6qr9Pg5/\n<S4ndm4nn> da war was mit dem gew\u00c3\u00bcnschten starteintrag dabei\n<S4ndm4nn> wie schlimm ist es doktor, wird er es \u00c3\u00bcberleben?\n<Rochvellon> erstmal gucken, ob ich was finde\n<Rochvellon> was ich auf die Schnelle fand: 01:08:49 Cube /usr/lib/gdm3/gdm-x-session[2214]: (EE) NVIDIA: Failed to initialize the NVIDIA kernel module.\n<Rochvellon> frag bitte nachher nochmal nach, ob andere was sehen\n<Rochvellon> S4ndm4nn ^^\n<S4ndm4nn> ja mit den grafikkarten treiber gab es schon \u00c3\u00b6ffters probleme nach einem update\n<S4ndm4nn> aber bisher hatte ich es immer selbst l\u00c3\u00b6sen k\u00c3\u00b6nnen\n<S4ndm4nn> ja es ist schon sehr sp\u00c3\u00a4t oder auch sehr fr\u00c3\u00bch am morgen, ich hab schon gemerkt dass es ein schlimmeres problem wird. werde mich morgen nochmals melden am besten \n<S4ndm4nn> eine sache wollte ich aber noch erw\u00c3\u00a4hnen\n<S4ndm4nn> dieses ubuntu hab ich ja schon sehr lange auf meinem pc und als immer \u00c3\u00b6fter fehler auftraten, hab ich mich entschlossen das neuste ubuntu 18 lts zu installieren.\n<S4ndm4nn> sobald ich es aber starte dauert es es eine ganz sch\u00c3\u00b6n lange zeit ca 10-15 minuten bis es start es wirkt so als ob es sich aufgehangen hat habe also ein schwarzes bild die ganze zeit \u00c3\u00bcber\n<Rochvellon> also wenn es an dem nvidia-Treiber liegen sollte, sollte eine Reinstallation abhilfe schaffen \"apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-384\" m\u00c3\u00bcsste das von Dir verwendete Paket sein\n<S4ndm4nn> bevor es startet sieht man noch eine fehlermeldung aufflackern und dann startet es ganz normal und l\u00c3\u00a4uft auch fehlerfrei \n<S4ndm4nn> okay versuch das eben nochmal\n<S4ndm4nn> ist aber doch kein dauerzustand immer wieder nach allen updates die grafikkarte neu zu installieren\n<S4ndm4nn> was das neue ubuntu angeht, ist meine hardware vielleicht zu veraltert oder woran kann das liegen\n<Rochvellon> was ist denn das f\u00c3\u00bcr ein System\n<Rochvellon> also ich gehe davon aus, dass Du eine relativ neue NVidia-Karte hast, da bei Dir der 384er installiert ist\n<S4ndm4nn> mainboard ist von gigabyte 970a-ud3 \n<Rochvellon> jo, so alt ist der Rechner nun auch nicht :)\n<S4ndm4nn> ja die karte ist nicht so alt aber das board und die cpu ist ein amd fx8 8120\n<S4ndm4nn> woran k\u00c3\u00b6nnte es liegen dass alle mint, ubuntu und debian nicht anst\u00c3\u00a4ndig booten im internet hab ich nichts dazu gefunden\n<S4ndm4nn> daher ging ich von der hardware aus\n<Rochvellon> also Du sagst, dass Du 18.04 installiert hast?\n<S4ndm4nn> ja ist auf einer anderen platte drauf \n<S4ndm4nn> wollte meine daten migrieren \n<Rochvellon> ach, paralell?\n<S4ndm4nn> ja\n<Rochvellon> weil ich sehe hier den Kernel 4.4, das ist der Standard-Kernel von 16.04\n<S4ndm4nn> ja das ist mein problem system\n<S4ndm4nn> naja das neue l\u00c3\u00a4uft zwar auch aber ben\u00c3\u00b6tigt beim booten \u00c3\u00bcber 10 minuten lang\n<Rochvellon> achso, und Du willst nur noch die Daten migrieren?\n<S4ndm4nn> ja weil das immer wieder probleme macht mit der grafikkarte\n<S4ndm4nn> \"apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-384\" hab ich mal eingegeben leider kann ich in diesem modus keine pakete laden\n<Rochvellon> ok, dann w\u00c3\u00a4re es doch besser, wenn wir uns dem 18.04 zuwenden und schauen, warum der Start dort so lange dauert\n<S4ndm4nn> internet verbindung geht leider nicht\n<Rochvellon> jo\n<S4ndm4nn> nur wenn es f\u00c3\u00bcr dich nicht all zu sp\u00c3\u00a4t ist\n<Rochvellon> also von dort auch die /var/log/syslog aber lass dir ruhig Zeit\n<S4ndm4nn> mal sehen ob da im recovery modus die internet verbindung geht\n<S4ndm4nn> also selbst um den recovery modus zu booten dauert lange\n<Rochvellon> sonst boote einfach in die normale Umgebung\n<S4ndm4nn> dauert genauso lange XD\n<Rochvellon> :)\n<S4ndm4nn> normal ist es doch nicht\n<S4ndm4nn> soll ich da auch mal dieses quiet splash entfernen?\n<S4ndm4nn> hmm bekomme aber nichts angezeigt mit oder ohne diesen eintrag, nur ein standbild und nun hei\u00c3\u009ft es warten\n<Rochvellon> S4ndm4nn: also ich hatte letztens mit einem anderen Laptop auch ein Problem mit dem nvidia-Treiber. Kernel m\u00c3\u00bcsste afaik 4.4 sein. Ich musste den Treiber (Treiberversion wei\u00c3\u009f ich jetzt nicht mehr) komplett deinstallieren und den nouveau-Treiber nutzen, weil ich mich sonst nicht einloggen konnte. Auf meinem Desktop mit 16.04, Kernel 4.4 und nvidia-352 habe ich allerdings diesbez\u00c3\u00bcglich keine Probleme\n<S4ndm4nn> scheint so als ob nvidia nicht nur bei mir probleme verursacht\n<S4ndm4nn> aber ohne diesen treiber l\u00c3\u00a4uft das system etwas sperriger\n<Rochvellon> gerade, wenn man es zum Daddeln nutzen m\u00c3\u00b6chte\n<S4ndm4nn> vor allem dann :-D\n<S4ndm4nn> aber auch so \n<S4ndm4nn> also jetzt sehe ich was\n<S4ndm4nn> steht alles auf OK\n<S4ndm4nn> aber weiter gehts nicht mehr :-(\n<S4ndm4nn> normaler weise ging es weiter\n<S4ndm4nn> das ist doch zum verzweifeln\n<S4ndm4nn> ach es ging eben weiter\n<S4ndm4nn> bild flimmerte kurz\n<S4ndm4nn> OK started nvidia persistence daemon\n<S4ndm4nn> und nun h\u00c3\u00a4ngt es wieder\n<Rochvellon> alternativ kann man auch mit einem Live-System nachgucken und ggfls. mit chroot ins installierte System eingreifen https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/chroot/Live-CD/\n<le_bot> Title: Live-CD \u00e2\u0080\u00ba chroot \u00e2\u0080\u00ba Wiki \u00e2\u0080\u00ba ubuntuusers.de (at wiki.ubuntuusers.de)\n<S4ndm4nn> okay geschafft\n<S4ndm4nn> es ist nun hochgefahren\n<S4ndm4nn> XD\n<S4ndm4nn> jetzt ist aber was seltsames passiert...hab ich eingeloggt und pastebinit installiert \n<S4ndm4nn> dann wurde alles dunkel und bin bin ich wieder in diesen status lade bild\n<S4ndm4nn> XD\n<Rochvellon> hm?

langen smart self test machen: sudo smartctl -t long /dev/X\n<p01nt3r> tomreyn, eine zeitlang ja, da gabs probleme mit dem home nachdem ich was zerschossen hatte, habe es dann iwann sauber neu aufgesetzt (betraf konfig-dateien in der /home, machten das system unbenutzbar)\n<p01nt3r> ist es normal, dass dann gleich wieder ein prompt da ist nach dem langen selbsttest? die ssd scheint nichts zu machen\n<tomreyn> also 260 mal ist ja schon recht viel. an sich sollte man das vermeiden. zum gl\u00c3\u00bcck ist das bei ssd's nicht so schlimm wie bei festplatten.\n<tomreyn> ja, ist normal. der selbsttest wird nur angesto0en und dann nach ca. ner stunde ist er fertig\n<p01nt3r> m\u00c3\u00bcsste die hdd-led jetzt nicht gl\u00c3\u00bchen?\n<tomreyn> du kannst dich mit \"sudo smartctl -a

nebenbei, damit du noch arbeiten kannst.\n<tomreyn> und das die firmware den selbst veranstaltet kriegt der controller das auch gar nicht mit\n<tomreyn> -das\n<p01nt3r> achso, es dringt also nicht nach aussen und somit leuchtet auch keine led\n<tomreyn> yo, die led ist ja ans mainboard verkabelt, da gibts so zwei pins wo die led bei bedarf strom her kriegt und dann leuchtet.\n<tomreyn> und ob sie strom kriegt entscheidet der sata-controller, der auf dem mainboard mit drauf sitzt.\n<tomreyn> die led wird also nicht von der ssd selbst gesteuert.\n<p01nt3r> ist oft auch so bei internen hdd-bays, da leuchtet dann auch nix\n<tomreyn> grunds\u00c3\u00a4tzlich f\u00c3\u00bchren inzwischen viele 'bauteile' im computer ein eigenleben, sind z.t. eigene mini-computer mit eigenr cpu und

nix\n<tomreyn> das das meist alles propriet\u00c3\u00a4rer code ist der da l\u00c3\u00a4uft (firmware blobs) wei\u00c3\u009f man dann in der regel auch nicht was die da machen\n<p01nt3r> die sache

Aber wie gesagt, st\u00c3\u00b6rt nicht. Allerdings: Alles was du eben getan hast, ist nicht permanent; sondern m\u00c3\u00bcsstest du nach einem Neustart wieder tun, wenn das Firewall-Skript von deinem VPS Anbieter die Regeln wieder erstellt hat. Um das nicht erneut tun zu m\u00c3\u00bcssen, m\u00c3\u00bcsstest du ebendieses Skript vom Starten abhalten. Da kann dir sicher der Support deines VPS Anbieters helfen.\n<sdx23> Ehm, das st\u00c3\u00b6rt nicht bezieht sich auf das ssh. Die anderen ACCEPTs muss man sich \u00c3\u00bcberlegen, ob sinnig.\n<Rojola> kann ich die regeln nicht einfach in einer startup-script irgendwo reinpacken?\n<Rojola> weil der support meines ISP's wird wenig helfen dabei\n<Rojola> das ist ein lokaler Anbieter und... \n<sdx23> naja, man kann wenig zahlen und schlechten Support haben - wenn man sich selbst genug auskennt.

I'm not sure how it all fits together but I thought this was the stuff they were offering to do for us.\n<xannen> Hi again.\n<head_victim> Gday xannen \n<sagaci> head_victim, what, figure out the requirements of each and every locale in existence\n<head_victim> sagaci: or is that the sort of thing we needed to provide to get them to build it?\n<sagaci> from what I gather, they've made the tools, we fill in the blanks and we can use their build system or live-build\n<head_victim> Ah ok,  don't mind me, I'm a little slow on the uptake on the technical aspects of things like this\n<xannen> I still have issues with 11.10.  :(  I'm on windows 7 now.  LOL\n<head_victim> xannen: what sort of issues?\n<xannen> Mainly graphics for now.  After a while, I get graphics lag.  And still have unity dash appearing on wrong screen for dual monitor.\n<head_victim> xannen: both of those seem like video driver issues to me.\n<head_victim> nvidia or ati?\n<xannen> Nvidia.\n<xannen> I didn't have these issues on 11.04.\n<head_victim> Firstly, open up the nvidia control panel and make sure the monitor you want set on the LHS is the primary monitor\n<head_victim> Soudns like it's swapped the primary monitor around\n<xannen> In 11.04, I had my primary monitor on the RHS, and unity dash appeared on that monitor -- as I liked it.  With 11.10, it worked in reverse.  This is filed as a bugged and not yet fixed.  But that's just me.  Also there was openjdk issue with versioning and dependency.\n<head_victim> Ah well, back up and reinstall 11.04\n<head_victim> ?\n<xannen> Yeah, I guess.\n<head_victim> I assume you've already tried all the different video drivers available?\n<xannen> Yep.  LOL.  From recommended and ppa.\n<head_victim> And nouveau?\n<xannen> By the way, how's the progress with \"ubuntu hour\"?\n<head_victim> Poorly\n<xannen> I tried to installed nouveau but the process is more complicated and stuffed it up.  :S\n<head_victim> The process is simply deactivating the nvidia drivers as far as I know.\n<xannen> Oddly, in 11.10, in the \"install additional driver\", nouveau was not offer.  It only showed proprietary.  :S  Which is oddly with linux open source philosophy.\n<head_victim> That's because nouveau isn't an additional driver. If you deactivate the nvidia one it defaults to nouveau.\n<xannen> Ah...  Okay.  Whatever happened to the option to use opensource nvidia driver then?  o.O\n<head_victim> nouveau IS the open source nvidia driver\n<xannen> Ah... okay...  I'm sorry, I am confused with these changes in settings (i.e. explicitly stating whether open source is used or not).\n<xannen> And I didn't know these information (i.e. if no proprietary gpu driver is specified, open source is used, if available.)\n<head_victim> No idea if the nouveau driver will do 3d though. I haven't used it in years.\n<xannen> It was a bad timing for me because when I bought my comp earlier this year, I only had windows use in mind.  A few months down the track, I decided to try out ubuntu.  If I know this, I would have bought \"open source supported\" hardware, e.g. intel or ati gpu, etc...\n<head_victim> I've always recommended nvidia for Ubuntu use personally. Been using them for 5 years without a hitch.\n<head_victim> Never once had an issue.\n<ikt> i was the same with ati up until 11.04\n<head_victim> I've never used ATI since I spent a month trying to get my 9600 to do 3d.\n<head_victim> Been with Nvidia ever since and used the proprietary drivers ever since. I know the purist hate that but it just works for me.\n<xannen> Haha...\n<xannen> I was using ati before I my nvidia and wanted to try out nvidia.  No problems on windows, obviously from better support.  I discovered intel gpu has open source support better than other gpu.  So in future I will consider intel.\n<head_victim> Intel have had their problems as well. But also, intel don't make stand alone GPUs. Therefore their performance is heaps lower than ati and nvidia.\n<xannen> I hope intel will offer better gpu and/or other gpu release their driver codes as open source. :D\n<head_victim> Intel only do integrated video. These will never rival standalone video cards for performance.\n<xannen> Do you have recommendation for touch screen laptop?\n<head_victim> Not really, never had a need for one so never spent time looking into them.\n<head_victim> Maybe ask on the mailing list for more ideas.\n<xannen> Okay.\n<head_victim> sagaci: had a look over that stuff. Looking good mate. Sorry I didn't get it before.\n<head_victim> Anyone else giving you any feedback on the brainstorming?\n<sagaci> I think I've made it available enough, with the blueprint and pad, anyone can add/suggest so it's just a case of people actually contributing\n<head_victim> Yeah that's what I was wondering, if anyone was actually contributing.\n<head_victim> I'm finding it hard drumming up support for events and stuff as well so wondering how it was going for you\n<sagaci> not really so far but can't let that slow it down, I can't really make it any more accessible as it is\n<sagaci> as long as you're set up for ubuntu development/lp/ssh/bzr, it's super easy to get it and fiddle around with the settings and recommit\n<head_victim> I'm not sure I'll ever be set up for dev but I've tried to help with the brainstorming and ideas part.\n<head_victim> I'm no good with technical stuff.\n<sagaci> it's a lot of trial and error, more error... fix one error and you get two more\n<head_victim> Finding the time is the killer.\n<sagaci> head_victim: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Specs/Oneiric/LocalizedCDImageTools#Rationale -- that's where I got the \"locos in control of the customisations\"\n<head_victim> Yeah, it does sound like a really good project.\n<head_victim> And provides enough info to get your teeth into it\n<sagaci> so how do we go about getting some consensus for the defaults if no one is contributing?\n<head_victim> Obviously if no one is objecting you're doing it perfectly to suit their needs :)\n<sagaci> obviously no one would mind a default www.justinbieber.com.au\n<sagaci> in their firefox bookmarks\n<head_victim> Speaking of justin beiber, good evening bejames \n<bejames> Hey!?\n<head_victim> You're the team pretty boy? I'm trying to make a tenuous link here.\n<bejames> Very tenuous.  You need glasses\n<head_victim> I've actaully gotten some since we last caught up.\n<head_victim> You have any ideas how we can scrounge up $500 for the installation festival?\n<bejames> Urrr no\n<head_victim> Everyone I can think of want details before handing over cash, but no one in the team seems interested in working out the details until we're sure it will go ahead :P\n<sagaci> head_victim: what do you think about this string https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+source/cups/+pots/cups/en_AU/+translate?show=new_suggestions\n<bejames> There must be another way to do this. Other teams seem to be able to pull this off without cost\n<head_victim> bejames: yeah the issue is finding a half decent venue to get enough publicity to get enouh people going\n<head_victim> sagaci: looks fine from here, printers do have waste bins :)\n<bejames> head_victim: And the key requirement is Power / Internet accesss?\n<head_victim> bejames: open to suggestions of free ones that we can use that will get people to :)\n<head_victim> bejames: that and publically accessible (interacting with the general public, not just people who are already involved in linux)\n<head_victim> Internet isn't a major thing either, we can probably do without that\n<bejames> head_victim: have BCC libraries been looked at?\n<head_victim> I had assumed they'd have the same cost as the edge is a part of the state library. I guess we should confirm that or not\n<xannen> Yes, go BCC library and teach elderly ubuntu linux.  :D\n<bejames> Free for community group if Im reading this correctly http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/libraries/hiring-library-meeting-rooms/index.htm#2\n<head_victim> bejames: looks right, what in that list would be most publically accessible, somwhere like Brisbane Square? Or Carindale/Chermside/Indooroopilly/Garden City type places?\n<head_victim> I gotta run, want to send an email to the list to see what the feedback is like?\n<bejames> head_victim:  bye\n<gggs> evening all\n<sagaci> hi\n#ubuntu-au 2012-10-24\n<head_victim> Here's one for all you facebook and kde fans, didn't even know it existed https://www.facebook.com/kubuntu.au\n<jea> who is running that?\n<head_victim> Not sure, if we knew it was someone sensible it might be ok to link to the main one.\n<jea> it is hard to tell what they are like based on the few posts there at the moment\n<head_victim> I found it looking around at that wah character\n<jea> ah, right. you would think that if he can find that page, you could find stuff for the questions he is asking\n<jea> unless he made the page\n<head_victim> Anything is possible, that being said wah has liked about 20 windows 7 pages as well\n<jea> they are an unusual character\n<head_victim> Yep, just trying to pick and choose the questions I answer so they don't break their system\n<jea> that is a good point\n<head_victim> Ah crap, it's nearly 3 already.

I would have expected it to work... is this to say that gvfs won't be built against g-o-a at any point, even for future releases?\n<darkxst> roasted, we still need to work out some things with g-o-a in the main archives, i.e. the bug jbicha posted\n<roasted> darkxst: ah, I thought that was a separate issue... evolution+gmail vs gvfs+owncloud.\n<darkxst> well the root issue is the same, i.e. gvfs can't have a runtime dependency on goa\n<roasted> ah\n<darkxst> jbicha, I don't get why he wants to avoid using gnome-desktop 3.8 symbol?\n<roasted> evolution with gmail and exchange seem to work great in 13.10, for what it's worth.\n<roasted> both with mail and calendars\n<darkxst> jbicha, ok I see, that symbol was removed\n<darkxst> jbicha, https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-settings-daemon/commit/?id=55fee0c57563b95deddc4396eec87ab6bee35d34\n<darkxst> might be better to use that git patch\n<jbicha> you can suggest that to him\n<darkxst> ok\n<darkxst> jbicha, so I assume ibus 1.5 will land soon?\n#ubuntu-gnome 2013-07-09\n<jbicha> I'm hoping it will land this week\n<darkxst> ok, g-s-d is basically blocked on lid close power actions\n<darkxst> (and possible wacom panel issues, which I can't test)\n<jbicha> I was thinking we should have ibus & indicator-keyboard land first and then start testing g-s-d 3.8\n<alexandros_c> hello, I just changed the gpu in my laptop from ati x1400 tp nvidia go 7900, do I have to reinstall the os?\n<darkxst> jbicha, ok I need to sort the lid close stuff anyway\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, no but you may need to make sure you have the correct X drivers installed\n<darkxst> it should boot up in fallback X\n<darkxst> then you can install nouvaeu or proprietry nvidia driver\n<alexandros_c> darkxst: do you know where to location the information to do it? Thanks for your response\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, see software & update and then additional drivers tab\n<alexandros_c> darkxst: thanks once again\n<alexandros_c> darkxst: it says that I am currently using a Gallium 0.4 on NV49\n<darkxst> its quite possible that nouveau is already installed, but its also likely that 3D is broken\n<alexandros_c> so reinstall the os?\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, run `glxinfo | grep -i opengl`\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, no\n<darkxst> check that command, if it says LLVM, then you just need to reinstall the driver\n<alexandros_c> darkxst: ok thanks, I have to install mesa-utils but I have to wait until the current update is finished\n<darkxst> settings->details might also tell you\n<alexandros_c> ok under driver it says Gallium 0.4 on NV49 and experience is standard\n<darkxst> ok not sure about that then, just get the glxinfo output\n<bjsnider> alexandros_c, how did you change the gpu in a laptop?\n<alexandros_c> bjsnider: because the ati x1400 was dying on me and causing the cpu using to always be high making the laptop unusable\n<bjsnider> no, i didn't ask why\n<bjsnider> i asked how\n<alexandros_c> lol\n<bjsnider> you'd have to change the whole board\n<bjsnider> the gpu is part of the chipset\n<alexandros_c> no\n<alexandros_c> with the dell inspiron 9400 the gpu can be changed\n<bjsnider> how?\n<alexandros_c> all I had to do was open up the laptop and unscrew the old gpu and screw in the new\n<bjsnider> ok, so it's an expansion card\n<alexandros_c> no it has a gpu port on the mobo\n<bjsnider> does it also have built-in intel graphics?\n<alexandros_c> no\n<alexandros_c> well actually it depends on what model you brought\n<bjsnider> were you not able to get a newer nvidia card than that?\n<alexandros_c> no only certain cards will fit the slot without moding the mobo\n<bjsnider> the newer blobs dropped support for hardware prior to the geforce 8\n<bjsnider> so the 304 series is the latest you can use\n<bjsnider> or you can use nouveau, whichever works better\n<alexandros_c> ok thanks, what about 3D acceleration?\n<bjsnider> both would provide it, certainly the blob would be superior\n<bjsnider> if that's your biggest concern, go with the blob\n<alexandros_c> what concerns are there?\n<alexandros_c> will it provide a performance boost?\n<bjsnider> nouveau would provide kms and plymouth\n<bjsnider> the lbob wouldn't\n<bjsnider> nouveau might be faster in 2d situations\n<bjsnider> then there's the ethical side if your interested in normative concerns. nouveau is foss\n<alexandros_c> what about nouveau 3d rendering?\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, like I said you will probably need to re-install the driver to get 3D rendering working\n<darkxst> X can only have a single GL driver installed at once\n<bjsnider> that is supported but there are a lot of edge cases where it doesn't work well. and in any case it will not be as fast as the blob\n<alexandros_c> so just use sudo apt-get install nouveau?\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, you could try 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-video-nouveau'\n<bjsnider> if he was using radeon before he doesn't have to change anything\n<alexandros_c> so 3d should be working then?\n<bjsnider> you would have to reboot of course\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, glxinfo will tell you if 3D is working\n<alexandros_c> one more question, I according to systems detail I am using Gallium 0.4 on NV49, why is it saying that if I am using nouveau?\n<bjsnider> nouveau uses gallium\n<alexandros_c> ok\n<bjsnider> it uses gallium to provide opengl\n<alexandros_c> hey I got for vendor noveau, renderer Gallium 0.4 on NV49 version 2.1 Mesa 9.1.3 shading language version 1.20 and nothing for extension\n<bjsnider> nothing?\n<alexandros_c> nothing\n<alexandros_c> is that bad?\n<bjsnider> can you run glxgears?\n<darkxst> thats just from the grep\n<alexandros_c> it is running\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, it is fine\n<bjsnider> and you're getting 60fps\n<bjsnider> it's syncing to vblank\n<alexandros_c> 114.198 fps\n<bjsnider> ok, you maybe don't have vblank\n<alexandros_c> is that good?\n<bjsnider> you're running gnome-shell?\n<alexandros_c> yes\n<bjsnider> can you drag a window back and forth across the screen to see if you've got tearing?\n<alexandros_c> with a bunch of extensions installed\n<alexandros_c> yes I did and there was no tearing\n<bjsnider> hm, whatever. anyway, opengl is working\n<alexandros_c> kool\n<alexandros_c> are you running ubuntu-gnome?\n<bjsnider> darkxst, you only have to worry about drivers if you're using a blob. all of the xorg drivers are preinstalled, and they all talk to the system mesa libgl. libgl is redirected through alternatives to the blob's libgl if that is used.\n<bjsnider> so you can switch graphics cards without making any changes other than rebooting\n<alexandros_c> yip\n<bjsnider> unlike windows, where it's a bigger meal than most users can handle\n<darkxst> bjsnider, right, guess I got momentarily confused, isnt something I do very often (switch cards)\n<bjsnider> yeah, mostly people switching cards are amd users who are sick of all the b.s.\n<bjsnider> in true howard beale fashion\n<darkxst> my amd card is permently disabled ;)\n<alexandros_c> so you are using intel?\n<bjsnider> sounds like a good bumper sticker to me\n<bjsnider> i'm using intel ivb and got no complaints\n<darkxst> yeh\n<alexandros_c> bjsnider and darkxst are you'll running ubuntu-gnome\n<alexandros_c> ?\n<darkxst> alexandros_c, yes\n<bjsnider> yeah\n<alexandros_c> I can't choose between unity and gnome-shell as Like both\n<alexandros_c> :)\n<alexandros_c> darkxst and bjsnider thanks for all your help\n<jessejazza> Is there a mailing list for ubuntu-gnome? If not at present is that intended?\n#ubuntu-gnome 2013-07-10\n<roasted> hello friends\n<roasted> having a surprisingly good experience @ 13.10 alpha\n<roasted> 3.10 kernel is pure <3\n<darkxst> pointer barriers too ;)\n<roasted> pointer barriers... for dual monitor setups?\n<darkxst> well pressure ones\n<darkxst> for message tray and activities\n<roasted> er, I didn't think that was in 13.10 yet due to 1.13 xorg?\n<roasted> I thought that was a 1.14 xorg feature?\n<darkxst> 1.14 has landed\n<roasted> oh nice\n<roasted> I simply edited my messageTray.js to something far less obnoxious than a 1000ms delay time.\n<roasted> how many devs are on the UbuGnome team?\n<darkxst> only a few\n<roasted> well you guys do a good job\n<roasted> that's for dang sure\n<roasted> I admittedly keep bouncing between Ubuntu GNOME and Fedora, but I'm just not seeing what I'm gaining by going to Fedora. Ubuntu GNOME has all I need.\n<roasted> at least, 13.10 will. the 3.10 kernel fixes some issues I was having on this particular laptop (so far, it seems)\n<mkeer> Hey... I was logging out from Ubuntu Gnome and it was taking a very long time (at least 5 minutes)\n<mkeer> I ended up turning my computer off\n<mkeer> and now I see Failed to load session \"gnome\"\n<mkeer> so I can only use the command line...\n<mkeer> any idea what is wrong?\n<bjsnider> mkeer, you're at the console?\n<mkeer> not right now\n<mkeer> (I logged on my windows computer)\n<mkeer> but I can access the console if I reboot...\n<bjsnider> well, if you're looking for a quick, one-word answer to what's wrong, there isn't one\n<mkeer> hmm, more precisely I have both Windows and Ubuntu on the same computer, but im on windows right now\n<mkeer> do you think just doing sudo apt-get install gnome\n<mkeer> would help?\n<mkeer> or like, sudo apt-get install gnome-shell or whatever its called\n<bjsnider> you have provided no background at all, so i can't say what would help\n<bjsnider> there are logs you can investigate\n<bjsnider> the package is ubuntu-gnome-desktop, not gnome\n<mkeer> ok, what logs can i look at?\n<jbicha> mkeer: which version of Ubuntu GNOME are you running?\n<bjsnider> do you know which display manager you're using, ie. lightdm or gdm?\n<mkeer> gdm\n<mkeer> Ubuntu GNOME 13.04\n<bjsnider> yeah, so the log is  ~/.cache/gdm/session.log\n<bjsnider> you might get some good info out of that\n<mkeer> ok ill check it out\n<mkeer> ty\n<mkeer> gnome-session[2285]: WARNING: Session 'gnome' runnable check failed: Child process exited with code 1\n<mkeer> doesn't seem very helpful\n<roasted> \\\n<roasted> oops\n<mkeer> doing a sudo apt-get install gnome\n<mkeer> hopefully it will help....\n<roasted> mkeer: he just said gnome isn't what you want.\n<mkeer> i did try sudo apt-get ubuntu-gnome-desktop and it didnt help\n<roasted> what about reinstalling it? (bjsnider jump in if I'm wrong). Something like, sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n<mkeer> ok... so the situation is a bit better... However, I see 2 tabs on the top\n<mkeer> Applications and Places\n<mkeer> which is not quite what I want\n<roasted> sounds like classic mode, I believe\n<mkeer> yes\n<jbicha> mkeer: what ppas do you use?\n<mkeer> no idea\n<jbicha> it sounds like a graphics driver issue\n<mkeer> Well, I dont know what ppas are\n<jbicha> oh don't worry about it, PPAs allow installing extra software that aren't in the Ubuntu repositories but that can cause problems sometimes\n<mkeer> I mostly just installed development stuff... python, eclipse,...\n<mkeer> not very much crazy stuff\n<mkeer> mostly stuff with installed with apt-get and python libraries...\n<jbicha> that should be fine\n<mkeer> do you think the fact that I did sudo apt-get install gnome caused this problem?\n<roasted> what GPU do you have mkeer\n<mkeer> Nvidia NVS 160m\n<mkeer> I installed the drivers from the NVIDIA website\n<jbicha> mkeer: that might be your problem\n<roasted> yeah....\n<roasted> I never install GPU drivers from their site. I always get them from the drivers menu or repos of whatever distro I'm using.\n<mkeer> but everything was working fine at first\n<jbicha> until you rebooted?\n<mkeer> well, I logged off and the system seemed to hang\n<jbicha> the new driver doesn't activate until you log off\n<mkeer> its possible that it was installing updates or something, but it didnt tell me so\n<mkeer> so should I be using the Nouveau drivers or...?\n<mkeer> ok, im looking at some guide for installing nvidia drivers\n<mkeer> Beautiful\n<mkeer> Thank you very much to both of you\n<mkeer> Blah... very many graphical glitches however\n<mkeer> screen turning partially black...\n<jbicha> basically I'd recommend figuring out how to uninstall the nvidia drivers you downloaded from their website, reboot and then use the final tab of the Software & Updates tool to try the available packaged drivers if you like\n<mkeer> Do you recommend lightdm vs gdm?\n<jbicha> there's not much difference but gdm has better integration with GNOME Shell (pretty lock screen)\n<mkeer> my cpu jumps to 30% usage just my moving the system monitor window\n<mkeer> nothing else is running\n<mkeer> not normal, right?\n<mkeer> My CPU is a T9600... quite old, but still 2.8ghz or so\n<jbicha> if you don't have working 3D acceleration from your graphics driver/card, GNOME Shell falls back to using CPU acceleration\n<mkeer> do you work for ubuntu gnome?\n<mkeer> (or contribute)\n<jbicha> yes, it's a volunteer project and I'm a volunteer\n<mkeer> im surprised by how linux distributions maintain consistency despite having people working from all over the world\n<namela> ubuntu -gnome say me that : 'can`t load session 'gnome'\n<namela> what can i do '? because i install this so yesterday...\n<vramana> Hello After reading this article http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/06/lubuntu-kubuntu-decide-against-mir-switch. I have waited for long time for some official announcement from Ubuntu GNOME But I haven't seen any. Can anybody what will happen to Ubuntu Gnome in future??\n<jbicha> vramana: there isn't anything really to announce at this point\n<vramana> Oh okay.\n<bjsnider> at some point, it's going to be wayland\n<bjsnider> whent hey're finished developing it in 48 years\n<vramana> bjsnider: Gnome 3.12 aims to use wayland by default.\n<vramana> It's release is around March 2014\n<vramana> So may be I can expect Ubuntu Gnome to use wayland on 14.10 I guss\n<vramana> *guedd\n<vramana> *guess\n#ubuntu-gnome 2013-07-11\n<unheeding> i've never felt better in my life\n<jbicha> darkxst: what do you want for the default homepage?\n<darkxst> jbicha, for firefox? what does ubuntu use?\n<jbicha> start.ubuntu.com\n<darkxst> not sure really, I sort of inclined to just give them a nice clean google page. but having the help/community links is nice\n<jbicha> I really like about:home but I don't know how long it will take for someone to try to fix ubufox (since it's only minimally maintained now)\n<darkxst> oh that is cool\n<jbicha> that's Firefox's real default and I've set it as my default for quite a while but when I tried setting it for Ubuntu GNOME I hit bug 1195367\n<ubot5> bug 1195367 in ubuntu-gnome-default-settings (Ubuntu) \"Firefox about:home doesn't work right when set with ubuntu-defaults-builder\" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1195367\n<darkxst> oh, so ubufox kills whatever you set then?\n<jbicha> no, I think we could set whatever web page we wanted but about:home is internal and it looks like the javascript is blocked for some reason\n<darkxst> weird\n<darkxst> jbicha, does anything show up in the error console ?\n<jbicha> Security Error: Content at about:startpage may not load or link to chrome://branding/content/icon32.png.\n<jbicha> that's it\n<darkxst> wouldnt have through that would block js though\n<meet> how unstable is an alpha version?\n<darkxst> meet, in general its quite stable\n<darkxst> however from time to time things might break for a short time\n<meet> but do these breakings affect the system critically?\n<darkxst> well that is unlikely, but its a development release so maybe occasionally something really bad will happen\n<meet> I have a dual boot. I am basically a hobbyist and frequently hop from distro to distro. And even if a major error occurs I may afford to replace the distro. Should I try it out? :D\n<darkxst> yeh sure\n<darkxst> like I said anyway its quite unlikely that anything critical will happen\n<darkxst> and if it did, sounds like you can boot back to backup distro anyway!\n<meet> ya..ok.. btw in 13.04 i was having many problems related to online accounts. Like many a times empathy would not connect or ask me to authenticate several times and many such problems. Have these been addressed?\n<darkxst> meet, we have removed ubuntu online accounts\n<darkxst> so hopefully that might be fixed\n<Nedwin> so i have an annoying problem. gnome online accounts would crash every time i tried to remove my google account. I was trying to remove because i could not authenticate with 2-factor authentication. i deleted it from some config files and that apparently fixed the problem. but upon boot i get an authentication request.\n<Nedwin> how do i stop these phantom authentication requests?\n<Nedwin> they come up when i start a search in the activities screen too.\n<Nedwin> should i just purge goa all together???\n<meet> Nedwin: i am not sure, but on ubuntu-gnome 13.10 release notes they have given a work around for problems with two factor authentication. have a look. here's the link: http://goo.gl/JT6Ir\n<Nedwin> cheers @meet\n<Nedwin> I hope that works. otherwise i might end up getting it twice.\n<Walli> hi\n<Walli> Hallihallo?\n<sazawal> Hi\n<unheeding> ( \u00cd\u00a1\u00c2\u00b0 \u00cd\u009c\u00ca\u0096 \u00cd\u00a1\u00c2\u00b0)\n<unheeding> >tfw you are using GNOME3.8\n#ubuntu-gnome 2013-07-12\n<roasted> hello\n<roasted> what is this crazy talk about 3.9.4 out already?\n<roasted> also, looks like 3.10 is slated for a late sept release. I wonder if that'll end up in 13.10 by default?\n<darkxst> ricotz, hi\n<ricotz> darkxst, hi\n<darkxst> I was thinking to start upload some 3.9 bits to the ppa, what do you think?\n<ricotz> darkxst, sounds fine\n<ricotz> while there is finally a cogl release, it would be nice to transition to it immediately then\n<ricotz> and enable the full wayland support with it\n<darkxst> yeh that would be good\n<ricotz> https://launchpad.net/~ricotz/+archive/unstable/+packages\n<ricotz> dont install those packages like that ;)\n<ricotz> there is a breaks missing which would prevent that\n<darkxst> ok\n<darkxst> ricotz, you added xwayland manually?\n<darkxst> considering it hasnt been merged yet afaik?\n<ricotz> yes\n<ricotz> this is more for testing, the xorg-edgers package includes it too\n<ricotz> there are still the ddx side patches needed\n<darkxst> ok cool, too bad I am stuck on the binary blob here\n<ricotz> yeah, intel is kind of the best to test it\n<darkxst> could never get my second monitor to work on nouvaeu\n<darkxst> my laptop has intel, buts its not really my dev playground. kind of needs to be stable ;)\n<ricotz> darkxst, that is fine\n<darkxst> maybe wayland works in vmware though?\n<Rand_> hello everybody! I have a great problem with my vuze on ubuntu 13.04 : the window is not responding before I get the gnome 3.8 it was working perfectly, I am on vuze 5.0 is someone know what to do ?\n<ricotz> darkxst, i guess it should\n<darkxst> Rand_, you might be better trying a more generic channel such as #ubuntu for that. Vuze is not part of gnome\n<darkxst> ricotz, I will try when I get a chance.\n<darkxst> I do remember seeing mentions of wayland support in the changelogs along the way though\n<ricotz> darkxst, it was quite in flux, but with the abi/api promise of wayland 1.1.91 it should calm down\n<ricotz> only gtk builds the wayland backend\n<ricotz> 3.9.8 require wayland 1.1.90\n<ricotz> to prepare the full support for mutter the support in cogl and clutter needs to be enabled too\n<darkxst> I pretty sure I don't have any Qt apps (excluding ubuntu apps)\n<darkxst> we have pretty much free reign on that this cycle though? assuming its actually ready\n<darkxst> Jono has some idea of a Mir backend for gnome-shell, lol ;)\n<darkxst> no idea where that will come from !\n<ricotz> huh?\n<ricotz> i *really* doubt that\n<darkxst> ricotz, yes me too\n<ricotz> the needed changes for mutter are quite something\n<ricotz> and no mir for gnome-shell, without support for mutter/cogl/clutter\n<ricotz> and gtk, of course\n<darkxst> yeh I know, its super complicated with just X and wayland\n<darkxst> no way upstream will take a 3rd complication\n<ricotz> absolutely\n<darkxst> I think jono is just dreaming....\n<darkxst> because there is no way canonical would do it. and its well beyond us\n<ricotz> let see what the future brings for mir\n<ricotz> i hope fedora will pick up testing GNOME/wayland soon\n<ricotz> or even debian\n<darkxst> fedora should! its always broken anyways ;)\n<ricotz> jfyi https://lists.launchpad.net/elementary-dev-community/msg02491.html\n<darkxst> ricotz, that sounds almost exactly the same as the conversation I had with jono\n<ricotz> darkxst, probably ;)\n<darkxst> apparently there is some delusional idea that upstream might consider ubuntu flavours as different distros\n<ricotz> darkxst, i hope they do in regards helping with wayland problems ;)\n<darkxst> well ironically, they may well if all the flavours switch to wayland\n<ricotz> is there an eta when mir lands in saucy?\n<ricotz> (the package itself)\n<darkxst> not entirely sure\n<darkxst> currently its just Xmir\n<darkxst> all input etc is still through X\n<ricotz> yeah, i know\n<darkxst> so really just a system compositor for rendering\n<ricotz> i am just curious about the init changes when this happens\n<darkxst> lightdm lauches u-s-c\n<ricotz> you mean session-compositor?\n<darkxst> yeh\n<darkxst> they call it unity-system-compositor of course!\n<ricotz> ok\n<darkxst> so there shouldnt be any init changes provided you are using gdm or other dm\n<ricotz> right\n<darkxst> you can force fallback by patching a conf file\n<darkxst> and I think there is also a lock file that is created after things fails, so lightdm doesnt bother trying again in case your system doesnt happen to work\n<darkxst> anyway at the end of the day wayland is the future for gnome\n<darkxst> and I am pretty sure we did bulk of work on landing the gnome 3.8 stack\n<darkxst> yet they won't provide any help for example making gdm work under Xmir\n<darkxst> ricotz, can you upload gtk 3.9.4? I will start uploading other packages then, when I get back from my adventures tomorrw\n<ricotz> darkxst, you mean 3.9.8?\n<darkxst> yeh that too\n<darkxst> I have been running on jhbuild so far this cycle\n<ricotz> it will break the unity menu stuff while there is no port of that patch\n<ricotz> if i get to it everything will go into gnome3-staging/saucy first\n<darkxst> ok sounds good\n<darkxst> I mean it would be better we don;t break unity, but the people using staging probably don't care\n<ricotz> darkxst, lars wasnt declined to work on porting the patch though if it is needed\n<darkxst> ricotz, ok, that is good I guess\n<darkxst> assuming wasnt == hasnt\n<roasted> hello friend\n<roasted> s\n<amjjawad> darkxst:\n<amjjawad> darkxst:\n<amjjawad> darkxst: I've been waiting here for a long time :(\n<amjjawad> darkxst: looks like you are not here\n<jbicha> amjjawad: he has to sleep some time ;)\n<amjjawad> jbicha: thanks :)\n<amjjawad> I will catch up with him later then.

Normally, I wouldn't let something so petty bother me.\n<craysiii>  However, when i turn off the computer and turn it back on, the log on screen appears on HP, even though it should appear on LG. waddaheck\n<craysiii> also, when logged in, LG is the one that has the task bar etc.\n<darkxst> craysiii, not sure its possible to override the monitor numbers, short of swapping the physical connects (assuming this is a desktop system)\n<darkxst> also gdm (login screen) does not support custom monitor configs, so it will always display on monitor 1\n<craysiii> lg is connected through hdmi and hp is connected through dvi. not possible to switch them. wish there was a way to reassign, oh well\n<SonikkuAmerica> craysiii: You could buy a multi-converter box for fairly cheap\n<craysiii> the hp only has dvi and vga, i have a dvi to hdmi cable that works for the hp, and i could buy a display port cable for the lg, but im afraid the hdmi is going to come up as a lower number than the display port\n<darkxst> craysiii, matbe possible with a custom xorg.conf\n<craysiii> ill check it out\n<joel__> yo\n<Joel___> Does anyone else feel like the ubuntu-gnome website needs an update?\n<Guest49133> .\n<jMcA> .\n<jMcA> Does anyone else feel like the ubuntu-gnome website needs an update?\n<darkxst> jMcA, artwork team are working on it\n<blurkis> hello.

I have a serious problem in that when I lock my computer, the screens blank, and as soon as my HDMI monitor goes into standby, the computer wakes back up and switching the monitor back on, this then loops until I come back, and once I unlock gnome-shell has become totally unresponsive until I ALT+F then r to restart it\n<alias_neo> it goes like this; Lock computer, all screens blank, hdmi monitor goes to sleep after ~5 seconds, this causes the screens to wake up, wakes the monitor again, showing lock screen, ~X seconds later sleeps again, minitor goes to sleep, computer wakes, lock screen again ... rinse and repeat\n<alias_neo> I@m quite happy for the screens never to sleep/blank if that's the only way to fix it\n<muelli> could anybody with patching power apply the commit mentioned in https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=767780 to the current staging builds..?

I've sshed into my machine and I need to mount a couple of disks. I would usually do this using gnome-disks when I'm on the machine locally but I don't know how to run it with the correct permission when I'm remote. Anyone now how?\n<drpantos> I cannot `sudo gnome-disks` because it then mounts them for root not my user\n<pchoo> Hi all, I've had my laptop running since this morning, and I'm starting to get little bits of lag in the UI.  I've noticed in my system gnome-settings-daemon has crept up to 16.4% memory usage (I've got 16GB RAM), this means it's using over 2.5GB.  Surely this can't be right?! Save rebooting my machine, what can I do to alleviate this?  I've also seen\n<pchoo> gnome-shell start using more and more RAM at times.

I'm having an issue where my shell inside gnome-terminal remembers which dir I'm in when I open a new tab - I don't want that... I'd like it to always start in the home dir. Is there any way to do this?\n<dsynapse> hi\n<dsynapse> I have a laptop with a hidpi screen (4k) but if I connect it to a 2k external or 1k external monitor, everything is WAY oversized when going to the smaller monitor.  The \"fix\" I have right now is that I leave hidpi scaling to 1 which is small on the laptop, but normal on the connected monitors...I was curious if there's a better way of doing this?\n#ubuntu-gnome
