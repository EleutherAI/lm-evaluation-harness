[["There are three important subpopulations of T Lymphocytes (T cells): helper T cells, which interact with B cells to amplify production of antibody; effector T cells, which carry out the direct cell-killing function of T cells and make certain lymphokines (non-antibody products) which are responsible for delayed hypersensitivity; and supressor T cells, which participate in the regulation of both antibody-medicated and cell-mediated immunity.\nT cells must be activated before any of these forms of activity are expressed. Usually the activation follows from exposure to antigen, but other less specific factors such a interleukin 2 are also believed to participate in the activation of T cells.\nUsually there is a latent period of around a week to 10 days after first exposure to antigen before the T cells develop initial reactivity. Shortly after that the reactivity subsides. Upon a second contact with antigen, T cells show an accelerated memory response with high activity developing within 2-5 days.\nThe addition of antigen to cultured lymphocytes induces a small proportion of T cells to differentiate into the large rapidly dividing blast cells. T cells can also be transformed by culturing them together with the lymphocytes of individuals of the same species, a so-called mixed lymphocyte culture. Because of extensive polymorphism at HLA loci, the two cell populations are virtually always different antigenically and they stimulate each other to undergo blast transformation. For example, isolated blood lymphocytes from recipient and prospective donor are maintained together for several days in tissue culture. Blast transformation occurs if allogenic cells are present. This process may be referred to as alloactivation. Mixed lymphocyte cultures may be established by treating one set of cells in a manner that prevents blast transformation of that set of cells such as irradiating the cells.\nA T lymphocyte will recognize an antigen only if the antigen is properly presented by a presenting cell which in many cases is a macrophage. The antigen must be presented juxtaposed to a compatible Ia molecule, a surface molecule coded for by one of the class I transplantation or histocompatibility genes. In man, there are at least two distinct families of Ia molecules encoded by mixed lymphocyte culture genes, HLA-DR and MT or DS. These genes control the formation of the specialized complementary Ia structures on the surface of a presenting cell and the T cells that provide for proper presentation of antigens. T cells may interact with B cells, or other T cells, if the cell possesses complementary Ia structures and if it recognizes the same antigenic determinant or a different determinant on the same antigenic molecule.\nDuring the process of activation, T cells develop new surface antigens, so-called T cell activation antigens. Most of these T cell activation antigens, however, are not T cell specific. For example, the transferrin receptor, the insulin receptor and the 4F2 antigen appear on proliferating cells of many types. Only one T cell activation antigen, Tac (Interleukin-2 receptor), is found only on activated T cells.\nThe kinetics of antigen appearance on activated T cells has been studied in order to gain some insight into the function of these molecules. Cotner et al. examined the kinetics of appearance of several T cell antigens and found that each exhibited a characteristic and reproducible time of appearance (9). Based upon this, the antigens could be classified as early, intermediate or late appearing antigens.\nThe relevancy of various cell surface markers to the functional heterogeneity of alloreactive T cell clones has been examined and the rearrangement of the T B-chain gene of the antigen receptor in wild and mutant variants of clones with altered phenotypes and function compared (7). BALB/C mice have been immunized with helper T cell clones to produce two monoclonal antibodies which detect distinct cell surface molecules associated with T cell helper activity and with the production of T replacing factor (8).\nThe 4F2 antigen, Tac, the 49.9 antigen and the transferrin receptor appear within 24 hours of mitogen stimulation, before the onset of DNA synthesis, and are classified as early antigens. Early appearing antigens may be associated with cell growth. The HLA-DR antigen and the 19.2 antigen (Ia antigen) do not appear until about 72 hours after activation and are classified as late antigens. Expression of the OKT 10 antigen by activated T cells is intermediate.\nThe molecule or molecules associated with T cell helper function are unknown. Human helper T cells are defined as lymphocytes which express the T4 surface antigen, a T cell specific glycoprotein molecule expressed by cells which recognize and are restricted by major histocompatibility complex class II antigens. This molecule is also found on killer and suppressor lymphocytes suggesting that the T4 molecule is not involved in helper function. Similarly, the T cell antigen receptor does not seem to be involved in any specific T cell function because the gene which encodes the B-chain of the receptor is rearranged and expressed by helper, suppressor and cytotoxic T cells."], ["1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to a solenoid valve. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling the solenoid valve to achieve a desired flow rate.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nSolenoid valves are used in a multitude of various operations. One use is the automotive industry wherein a solenoid valve is used in conjunction with a vapor canister in a vehicle emission system. For instance, under normal operating conditions, fuel vapors from the vehicle's fuel tank are stored in the vapor canister. The canister is purged by drawing fresh air through the canister into the intake manifold of the engine. Purging the canister disrupts optimum air-fuel ratio and may result in inefficient operation of the engine. Thus, a solenoid valve is used to control the flow rate of fuel vapor being drawn from the vapor canister into the intake manifold.\nModern engines are tightly tuned for optimum operating performance. The amount of canister purge vapor entering the intake manifold is controlled by the solenoid. The solenoid valve is turned on and off or cycled based on various operating parameters. The duty cycle or percentage of time that the solenoid valve is open regulates the flow of fuel vapors being purged from the canister.\nVarious types of control systems to control or regulate the desired flow of fuel vapor from the vapor canister are known. One type of system controls operation of the solenoid valve through a duty cycle pulse width modulation. Duty cycle pulse width modulation control systems use from 5 to 100 percent of the duty cycle to vary the flow. Such systems fail to provide the flexibility necessary to control and, more specifically, regulate flow at both the low and high ends of the duty cycle. For instance, the slope of the flow rate versus percent duty cycle for optimum low end control may not be suitable for high end flow and vice versa.\nThus, it is advisable to have a control system which provides optimum flow control characteristics throughout the entire range of the duty cycle. For instance, the flow rate may be modified independently of the duty cycle wherein the overall slope of the flow rate with respect to the duty cycle may change for various percentages of duty cycle.\nAnother type of control system uses a current signal to actuate an armature so that flow is proportional to current. These control systems tend to have more hysteresis and are not useful for the initial 25 percent of the full scale signal."], ["Existing communications methods and systems are overly power hungry and/or spectrally inefficient. Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such approaches with some aspects of the present method and system set forth in the remainder of this disclosure with reference to the drawings."], ["In many applications, such as radar warning receivers (RWRs), there is a need to detect short-pulse signals with high probability.\nFrequency-swept detectors and spectrum monitors are not well-suited to being short-pulse signal detectors since they suffer low dwell times in each frequency band.\nShort-pulse signals can be detected using a digital instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) technique based on an analogue frequency discriminator and reference is made to P. L. Herselman and J. E. Cilliers: \u201cA Digital Instantaneous Frequency Measurement Technique using High-Speed Analogue-to-Digital Converters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays\u201d (2007). A conventional frequency discriminator typically comprises a splitter, a delay line, a mixer and a low-pass filter. Using the splitter, delay line and mixer, an input signal is mixed with a delayed copy. The product is fed through a low-pass filter. The frequency of a single input tone can be found using a look-up table. However, one drawback of such a system is that it can \u201cblinded\u201d by an extra input tone. Another drawback is that such a system tends to suffer from having a limited dynamic range.\nUS 2011/0053538 A1 describes a high-speed frequency sensor. The sensor comprises a plurality of filters allowing passage of signals over a different band of frequencies and a plurality of detectors, each associated with a respective filter. If the incident RF signal results in a signal in the band of frequencies passed by a particular filter, the detector associated with that filter generates an output signal. This indicates in which of the frequency bands the incident RF signal has been detected. The precision of the frequency estimate is limited to one bin per filter, that is, the sensor determines only a range of frequencies within which the single frequency exists, the range being equal to the band of frequencies passed by the filter."], ["The invention relates to a method for decontaminating nuclear reactors employed to generate electric power and more particularly to a method for performing full system decontaminations on boiling water reactors.\nDuring on-line power generating operations of commercial boiling water nuclear reactors, thin layers of metal oxides tend to build up on the internal surfaces of vessels and other components and piping in contact with circulating primary coolant (essentially high temperature water). Activated metal ions in the central core regions in reactor pressure vessels are entrained in the primary coolant and then are absorbed in the metal oxides, which results in relatively high radiation levels on these surfaces. It is desirable to reduce the radiation levels to xe2x80x9cAs Low As Reasonably Achievablexe2x80x9d levels in order to reduce the exposure of personnel working near the reactors during periodic plant outages and/or plant decommissioning operations. Thus, the industry may employ one or a combination of various known chemical decontamination treatments, e.g., acid permanganate, alkaline permanganate, Citrox, CAN-DEREM, LOMI and/or other processes, in order to dissolve or break up the oxide films. Conventionally, these decontamination processes involve the addition of permanganate, oxalate, citrate, EDTA and/or other ions to the primary coolant to form decontamination solutions and then the circulation of the solutions through the components to be decontaminated. In addition to removing the oxide layers, it may be desirable to remove several microns of base metal in order to better protect personnel during decommissioning processes. Dilute chemical decontamination solutions generally contain less than about 3-5% by weight of such decontamination agents. Chemical decontaminations may be performed upon full primary coolant systems or upon selected subsystems. Full system decontaminations are the preferred approach when the goal is to reduce dose rates on multiple subsystems throughout the plants. In addition, full system decontamination processes are generally performed with nuclear fuel assemblies out of the central core regions of the reactor pressure vessels, but the fuel assemblies may be retained in the central core regions in some cases.\nThe activated metal ions that are removed from the internal surfaces of the primary coolant systems in the course of the decontamination operations are collected on cation exchange resins. The activated resins must then be removed to remote disposal sites.\nThe majority of the activated oxide deposits in boiling water reactor primary coolant systems are located in the central core regions of reactor pressure vessels. These deposits do not substantially contribute to personnel exposure. Thus, it would be very desirable to decontaminate only those systems that substantially contribute to personnel exposure and bypass the central core regions. This would substantially reduce the total exposure of personnel while reducing resin and disposal costs.\nIt is an object of the present invention to decontaminate a portion of a reactor pressure vessel in a boiling water reactor and its appurtentant recirculation system while bypassing its central core region. It is a further object to substantially decontaminate a boiling water reactor with lower overall personnel exposures to radiation and lower resin costs.\nWith these objects in view, the present invention resides in a method of decontaminating a boiling water reactor having a plurality of reactor recirculation loops hydraulically connected in parallel with a reactor pressure vessel. Such a reactor pressure vessel has: a central core region; an annulus region surrounding the central core region and in hydraulic communication with the recirculation loops; and a lower internals region in hydraulic communication with the central core region. In the practice of the present invention, a decontamination solution is circulated through at least one of the reactor recirculation loops and the annulus region of the pressure vessel without circulating through the central core region. In a preferred practice of the present invention, the decontamination solution also circulates between the annulus region and the lower internals region without circulating through the central core region. Thus, a boiling water reactor can be substantially decontaminated while reducing overall personnel exposure and generating less resin wastes."], ["1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a hydraulic circuit, and in particular to a hydraulic circuit including an accumulator having an inflow passage which introduces a hydraulic fluid which is discharged from a hydraulic pump into a hydraulic fluid chamber and a discharge passage which discharges the hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic fluid chamber to a hydraulic actuator.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nAn example of this type of hydraulic circuit is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent No. 2576998. In the disclosed hydraulic circuit, a hydraulic fluid which is discharged from a hydraulic pump is introduced into a hydraulic fluid chamber of an accumulator through an inflow passage, and then the hydraulic fluid is discharged from the hydraulic fluid chamber of the accumulator to a hydraulic actuator such as a hydraulic booster through a discharge passage. As a result, pulsations of the hydraulic fluid discharged from the hydraulic pump are securely decreased by the operation of the accumulator.\nIn the case where an accumulator which operates when the pressure in a hydraulic fluid chamber is at least a set pressure is used to decrease pulsations of the hydraulic fluid discharged from a hydraulic pump, in a transient period until the pressure in the hydraulic fluid chamber reaches the set pressure, the accumulator does not operate, and pulsations of the hydraulic fluid which is discharged from the hydraulic pump cannot be decreased."], ["Systems that network voicemail systems to facilitate a distributed office, include, without limitation, networks by Cisco\u00ae, Advanced Voice\u00ae, etc. Networks like that of Cisco\u00ae have included voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) communications. However, prior networked voicemail systems do not transfer the session of the caller from one system to another system of the network using speech VoIP to transfer the session. Instead, prior systems transfer messages or calls but not the entire session. Accordingly, since the entire session is not transferred, the caller typically cannot speak to several people at the distant location, leave messages for several people at the location, broadcast messages at the location, etc. all as though they were at the other location.\nIn view of the above, there is a continuing need for a network of attendant, messaging and content-based speech systems to facilitate a distributed office wherein each system can transfer a session of a caller to another system at a distant location so that the caller can speak to several people at the distant location, leave messages for several people at the location, broadcast messages at the location, etc. all as though they were at the other location.\nAdditionally, there is a continuing need for a network of self-synchronizing attendant, messaging and content-based speech systems that automatically updates other systems in the network with extension database additions, deletions or other changes.\nAs will be seen more fully below, the present invention is substantially different in structure, methodology and approach from that of the prior e-trading systems and methods."], ["Vehicle windows (e.g., windshields, backlites, sunroofs, and sidelites) are known in the art. For purposes of example, vehicle windshields typically include a pair of bent glass substrates laminated together via a polymer interlayer such as polyvinyl butyral (PVB). It is known that one of the two glass substrates may have a coating (e.g., low-E coating) thereon for solar control purposes such as reflecting R and/or UV radiation, so that the vehicle interior can be more comfortable in certain weather conditions. Conventional vehicle windshields are made as follows. First and second flat glass substrates are provided, one of them optionally having a low-E coating sputtered thereon. The pair of glass substrates are washed and booked together (i.e., stacked on one another), and then while booked are heat bent together into the desired windshield shape at a high temperature(s) (e.g., 8 minutes at about 600-625 degrees C.). The two bent glass substrates are then laminated together via the polymer interlayer to form the vehicle windshield.\nInsulating glass (IG) window units are also known in the art. Conventional IG window units include at least first and second glass substrates (one of which may have a solar control coating on an interior surface thereof) that are coupled to one another via at least one seal(s) or spacer(s). The resulting space or gap between the glass substrates may or may not be filled with gas and/or evacuated to a low pressure in different instances. However, many IG units are required to be tempered. Thermal tempering of the glass substrates for such IG units typically requires heating the glass substrates to temperature(s) of at least about 600 degrees C. for a sufficient period of time to enable thermal tempering.\nOther types of coated articles also require heat treatment (HT) (e.g., tempering, heat bending, and/or heat strengthening) in certain applications. For example and without limitation, glass shower doors, glass table tops, and the like require HT in certain instances.\nDiamond-like carbon (DLC) is sometimes known for its scratch resistant properties. For example, different types of DLC are discussed in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,303,226; 6,303,225; 6,261;693; 6,338,901; 6,312,808; 6,280,834; 6,284,377; 6,335,086; 5,858,477; 5,635,245; 5,888,593; 5,135,808; 5,900,342; and 5,470,661, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.\nIt would sometimes be desirable to provide a window unit or other glass article with a protective coating including DLC in order to protect it from scratches and the like. Unfortunately, DLC tends to oxidize and burn off at temperatures of from approximately 380 to 400 degrees C. or higher, as the heat treatment is typically conducted in an atmosphere including oxygen. Thus, it will be appreciated that DLC as a protective overcoat cannot withstand heat treatments (HT) at the extremely high temperatures described above which are often required in the manufacture of vehicle windows, IG window units, glass table tops, and/or the like. Accordingly, DLC cannot be used alone as a coating to be heat treated, because it will oxidize during the heat treatment and substantially disappear as a result of the same (i.e., it will burn off).\nCertain other types of scratch resistant materials also are not capable of withstanding heat treatment sufficient for tempering, heat strengthening and/or bending of an underlying glass substrate.\nAccordingly, those skilled in the art will appreciate that a need in the art exists for a method of making a scratch resistant coated article that is capable of being heat treated (HT) so that after heat treatment the coated article is still scratch resistant. A need for corresponding coated articles, both heat treated and pre-HT, also exists."], ["1.

When the electronic device is to be mounted, a threaded member is partially received in a threaded hole in the wall and also partially received in the mounting hole in the rear face. However, the threaded member is prone to detachment since the allowable length thereof is limited.\nTherefore, there is room for improvement within the art."], ["Control of the temperature of reactions within an acceptable range has been widely investigated and the chemical industry has devised several arrangements, those commonly used being discussed in standard references and texts, e.g. one might consider the general teachings by Octave LEVENSPIEL in Chapter 19 of Chemical Reaction Engineering (published by John Wiley & Sons).\nThe prior art includes a conventional reactor designed to offer more control over the reactant temperature and this is known as the staged adiabatic packed bed reactor. This system uses an arrangement wherein a number of discrete, spaced apart zones of reaction are provided with means therebetween to control the temperature of the products leaving a first zone of reaction prior to entering the next reaction zone. No heat exchanging means is provided to control the temperature of the reaction in the zones of the reaction. Thus the reactant fluid entering the reactor at a desired temperature passes through a packed bed containing catalyst. Upon exiting this first stage, the reactant gas and any products will have a temperature higher or lower than that of the initial temperature depending upon the reaction thermal characteristics. A heat exchanger then heats or cools the reactant gas to a second desired temperature, which may or may not be equivalent to the temperature of the first, before passing to the next packed bed i.e. the second stage. This sequence is repeated until the desired conversion is obtained. Thus the temperature profile of the reaction will be stepped within an acceptable range of temperature, and will therefore not be truly isothermal.\nThe preferred heat exchanger panel for the purposes of the invention is one formed from a plurality of plates superposed and diffusion bonded to form a stack of plates, wherein fluid passages are defined in said stack by virtue of a pre-treatment of said plates wherein each plate is selectively configured to provide channeled or blank surfaces according to the desired pattern of fluid passages by a treatment to remove surface material e.g. by chemical etching, or hydraulic milling, or the like process to a desired depth. Optionally the chemical treatment may be augmented by a mechanical treatment using a suitable tool.\nSuch a pre-treatment of the plates is conducted in a manner analogous to manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and for this reason the heat exchanger design can be described as a printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE). The application of the diffusion bonding technique for metal plates is well understood in the art of metal working and is applied for a variety of purposes e.g. in medical prosthesis manufacture.\nThis design of the PCHE has been proven by the designers of the proposed PCR system since 1985 when these compact heat exchangers were first introduced.\nA PCR type of reactor was designed by the present applicants and is the subject of a separate patent application (Ref:32 46271 WO-). Such a reactor is formed to provide at least one reaction zone, bounded by a heat exchanger formed from a plurality of plates superposed and diffusion bonded to form a stack of plates, wherein fluid channels are defined in said stack by virtue of pre-treatment of said plates wherein each plate is selectively configured according to the desired pattern of channels by a chemical treatment to remove surface material e.g. by chemical etching, to a desired depth. The fluid channels defined in the stack provide the opportunity to arrange for various reactant fluids to be conveyed in channels arranged in a heat exchange relationship with discrete channels containing at least one auxiliary fluid for controlling the temperature of the reactants.\nConsidering the example of a known ammonia converter, for a given ammonia content in the reactants there is a temperature for which the desired reaction rate is at a maximum. This is because the rate of synthesis of ammonia is the net result of the competing rates of the forward and reverse reactions. Consequently, by monitoring and controlling the temperature, it is possible to determine a temperature that favours the forward production reaction more than the reverse product dissociation reaction. In fact it is found that whilst increased temperature generally causes an increase in reaction, and indeed the desired forward product formation reaction rate increases favourably with temperature, at a certain approach to equilibrium conditions the concurrent increased rate of the reverse reaction begins to dominate, and to slow the overall synthesis rate. Maximum conversion in a bed of given size is therefore achieved if conditions remain on the maximum rate line. This is shown graphically in FIG. 1.\nAmmonia synthesis typically takes place at high pressures, greater than 100 bar and therefore creating bed volume is relatively expensive. Furthermore, the catalyst itself is costly. Consequently, an important element of ammonia synthesis reactor design is to attempt to maintain the bed conditions as closely as possible to the maximum reaction rate line, and hence to maximise the rate of ammonia synthesis in a bed of a given size.\nVarious approaches have been taken to achieving this result, mainly falling into the categories of:\n1. Quench-cooled multi-bed converters, in which cold reactant feed is injected between beds of catalyst,\n2. Tube-cooled converters, in which tubes carrying cold reactant are embedded in the catalyst bed, and\n3. Indirectly cooled multi-bed exchangers, in which heat is extracted from the hot reactants passing between beds in heat exchangers cooled by cold reactant feed.\nAn example of a quench type converter is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,663,179 wherein there is provided a vertically oriented container or reactor vessel, which is provided with an internal catalyst basket in which a bed or charge of catalyst particles is disposed. The basket is spaced from the container wall, and the feed fluid stream such as synthesis gas is passed onto the lower portion of the container and external to the basket. The feed fluid rises through the annular space between the basket and the container wall, and thus serves to cool the container and act as insulation against the thermal effects or hot spots generated within the catalyst bed. The rising warmed feed fluid stream is then heated to a suitable catalysis temperature by an internal heat exchanger. The hot fluid then flows to the catalyst bed in which the reaction takes place.\nA perforated pipe is disposed in the catalyst bed, and a cold quench fluid, which may be of a composition comparable to the feed stream is passed through the pipes and distributed into the hot reacting gas within the catalyst bed, to provide a cooling effect and thereby moderate the catalytic reaction.\nAmmonia synthesis is exothermic, typically operating in the 350\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C. range, and the conversion factor is relatively low, typically less than 20%. As a result, it is possible for the cold feed stream to the reactor to be used to extract the reaction heat, at the same time preheating the cold feed stream to the required reaction temperatures. It is conventional practice to use the feed stream as a cooling medium in this way in ammonia converters. Related documents U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,669 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,680 describe such a converter in which the cold feed stream is used to extract the reaction heat and also includes a cold feed bypass line such that a controllable volume of the cold feed stream can by-pass the heat exchangers and therefore better control of the reactant temperature can be achieved.\nThis converter is an example of an indirectly cooled multi-bed exchanger as briefly outlined at point 3 above. It is an approach to bed cooling that is generally preferred by those in the art. In prior art converters though, only a very crude tracking of the maximum reaction rate curve is achievable in the reactor, due to the difficulties in cost-effectively arranging for more than two beds with inter-cooling by the feed stream. The general form of the temperature profile achieved with the common two-stage arrangement is illustrated in FIG. 2. The proposal outlined in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,230,669 and 4,230,680 mentioned above actually has three catalyst beds, but even so performance leaves room for improvement and the design cannot be considered compact.\nOther examples of ammonia converters are described in the publication \u201cAmmonia and Synthesis Gas, Recent and Energy-saving Processes\u201d edited by F J Brykowski and published by Noyes Data Corporation in 1981.\nAn object of the present invention is to provide an improved reactor design, particularly one that is useful for the purposes of ammonia conversion and the like reactions, and is furthermore of a relatively compact design."]]
