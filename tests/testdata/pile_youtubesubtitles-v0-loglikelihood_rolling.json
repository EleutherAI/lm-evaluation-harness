[["today we're going to talk about some\nessential oil mistakes that people make\nwhen they're first starting out and some\npeople wind up using essential oils for\na little while\n6 mistakes you don't want to make stay\ntuned until the very end because you're\nnot gonna want to miss these after this\nyou'll know a better way to safely use\nessential oils number 1 of thinking that\nbecause essential oils are all-natural\nthat they are completely safe nothing\ncould be further from the truth\noils are extremely powerful and should\nbe used with respect just like anything\nelse that is powerful for example one\ndrop of peppermint oil is the equivalent\nof 68 cups of peppermint tea when was\nthe last time you drink 68 cups of\npeppermint tea in one sitting one drop\nof orange oil is the equivalent of 150\npounds worth of orange rinds like I\ndon't think I want to watch anyone eat\nthat many orange rinds so they're\nextremely powerful they're not\ncompletely safe you have to use them\nwith respect even if you have the best\nquality oils which I believe that I use,\nI still use them conservatively because\nthey are so potent the number 2 thing\nthat people do and I see this frequently\nessential oils are all over the place\nthey are at the grocery store there are\nevery little tchotchke shop they are\nliterally everywhere but making sure\nthat you have a good quality oil is\nreally important and just like outerwear\nyou can pay $50 for a jacket at Walmart\nor you can pay 300 for a North Face\njacket well which company do you think\nis doing more R&D to make sure that\nyou're getting the most for your money\nI'm not saying the most expensive oils\nare the best but I'm saying go with the\ncompany that you know has a large\ntesting protocol and make sure that you\nare confident in that just because you\nsee something on the Shelf doesn't mean\nthat it's a good quality a lot of people\nthink that\nas the FDA regulate as generally\nregarded as safe that that means that\nthere's some kind of standard that they\nhave well let me tell you the standard\nthat they have is one drop of oil in\nthat bottle has to be essential oil and\nthe rest can all be carrier oil even if\nit says organic that just means all of\nthe carrier oil has to be organic so\nmake sure you're using a good quality\noil that you know is tested for the\nexact chemical profile of the plant that\nyou're looking for number 3 mistake not\ndiluting people and I see this all the\ntime people are like oh yeah just put it\non your neck or put it on your wrist or\nput it you know on your body it's called\napplying \"neat\" and I'll say that most of\nthe time I don't apply oils the neat I\nam 99.9% of the time I dilute essential\noils and that's for a couple of reasons\none skin sensitivities develop over time\nyou may not know the first time you use\nthat oil or even the 50th time you use\nthat oil but the 51st time you use\nthat oil you get skin sensitivities so\nwhat diluting it does is make sure that\nit spreads it out over a larger surface\narea of the skin and it reduces the\nprobability that you'll have a skin\nsensitivity so make sure that you're\ndiluting it number 3 mistake....  you\nwill hear people all over the place\nsaying just put this in your water put\nlemon oil on your water put peppermint\noil in your water taking oils internally\nis a completely different can of worms\nand this is what I'll say should you\ndecide to do that make sure that you're\nonly drinking or putting essential oils\nin a stainless steel or glass container\nthat includes the straw so in when\nessential oils come in contact with\nplastic they actually release fake\nestrogens which go into your body\nattached to your estrogen\nreceptors which  leads your body to believe that\nyou have more estrogen that you do than\nyou do in your body and it can\ncompletely disrupt your endocrine system\nso glass that doesn't happen with and \nstainless steel that doesn't happen with check out my video about if your dryer sheets are killing you.\nI've actually seen it essential oils eat\nthrough styrofoam and so then who knows\nwhat you're ingesting if you do that so\nmake sure that you don't have a\nstainless steel water bottle with a\nglass straw or with a plastic straw or a\nglass water bottle with a plastic top\nlike my favorite thing to use is a glass\nmason jar with the stainless steel top\nthat has a stainless-steel straw stuck\nthrough it that way there's no chance\nthat those oils are coming into contact\nwith any kind of silicone or plastic\nthat they can potentially release\nchemicals from.  The number 4 Danger is using photosensitive\noils and then going out into the Sun\neven if you dilute it properly\nphotosensitive oils will create a burn\nor a skin reaction when they're exposed\nto the Sun so these in general are your\ncitrus oils and cumin you want to make\nsure that your citrus oils and cumin\nthat you're if you're applying them\ntopically you're applying them to a part\nof your body where it will not be\nexposed to sunlight should you decide to\ngo out in the Sun.  Check out my video on essential oils and sun safety.   The next mistake that\npeople make is blasting their diffuser\nall day long so every time those\nparticles are in your area you breathe\nthem in your body has to process it just\nlike it processes everything else that\nyou've taken to your body anything you\nbreathe in anything you eat drink so a\nbetter practice would be to turn the\ndiffuser on for equal amounts of time\nthat you turn it off I love diffusing\nand so I will typically diffuse for a\nfew hours\nturn the diffuser off let it rest for a\ncouple hours I\nturn it back on or I'll turn my diffuser\non for four hours in the morning and\nthen right before my husband gets home\nfrom work I'll turn it on for a few\nhours in the evening and then I turn it\noff just to give my body a rest if you\nstay away from these five big

those sacrifices from the Pakistanis\nshould be acknowledged it's been a huge\nhuge undertaking for them I think the\nfact that we're here today and we're\nwitnessing UK Pakistanis security\nworking

It is quite curious to note\nIn these readings, there is no mention on\nThe strict homology between tautology, the structure on which Lacan insists\nsince it is of course, about using  his theory of  the 4 discourses and how they differ\nthe three HUM discourses and the A discourse. notice that it makes HUMA as human\nWhat Lacan particularly insists on\nThis is precisely what we would like to come back : there are three discourses\nwhich are spherical discourses and one\ndiscourse which is of Moebian structure\nWhat does that mean? It means...\nthat for each\nMaster, hysterical, academic, there's an inside and an outside...\nThese are discourses that Lacan describes as univocal: one is either inside or outside...\nthese three discourses are the modalities\n(we're in the modal), the modalities of substitution of absent sexual intercourse\nI'm gonna come back to that because\nobviously if I say it just in a crude way.\nit might cause a little problem of interpretation.\nso those three discourses are what\nthe speaking being that we are\nmakes up for the absence of sexual relation\nso we've seen this a few times, but\nwe have to come back to it again\nThe master's discourse is a discourse that rests...\n...truth makes structure of  every discoure\nthe truth is on the bottom left .\nit's the barred S, the division of the subject, and this division, we've seen it,\nIs caused by the signifier, by the fact that\nwe're already spoken before we can be speak\nand the arrow pointing to the upper left to the semblance\nOf the signifier and the one that leads to the top right\ntowards jouissance is going to stage right now S1 and S2.\ni.e. the master signifier that connects to the knowledge S2\nThis top line is marked with the seal of the impossible...\nI remind you that these three\ndiscourses represent an impossible\nalready spotted by Freud\nthe impossible there obviously in the master discourse  is the impossible to govern\nthe impossible to govern, is shown as the impossible between s1 and s2\nthe master signifier in its connection to knowledge\nThere's something about the impossible...\nAnd the production, what's going to fall out of it, is object a. that's where it gets interesting.\nWhat I haven't told you yet\nis that  this little a, here, well, it's in this way that\na universe can take consistency ( but\nit's an imaginary consistency)\nBecause that little a is what makes function of being\nbut I remind you that we are in a\ndiscourse so there is no being\nThe being that falls there is a letter. \nTo say: the letter \"a\" comes to serve as a fiction of being\nand from there a referential universe is created\nfrom there we can\nimagine that the words refer to something else\nthan to the chain of signifiers, i.e. a\nsignifier that will define itself in relation to another signifier\nby just a difference from this signifier\nSo words that interdefine each other...\njust by one small difference\nBetween \"Bois\" and \"Pois\" between \"Boire\" and \"Poire\"\nit's just differences\nWho will define signifiers as\ndifferent from themselves,\nso a signifier is always defined in relation to another signifier and in the difference it has with another signifier\nBut from the moment the word took the place of the thing...\nso the master's discourse\nthe establishment of the master's discourse; from that moment on there is a fall,\nthere is a loss because language can't take it all .\nall encompassed and therefore all that is not encompassed by language\nI remind you it's a spherical discourse.\nSo what's not taken from the\nsphere of language falls in the form of an object\nbut that object there is a letter; the letter is the edge.\nit's the littoral, it's the literal, it's the\nedge between what is the order of a discursive constitution\nthat's gonna lead us down a meaningful chain\nbetween one signifier and another signifier etc. and we will construct\nan imaginary world, a consistant universe\nfrom this letter\nwe can say that Lacan at that moment\nwarns us and tells us that\nThere's nothing else in the world that a small object a,\nwhich is a little hard to swallow anyway.\nsince you say: \"No, look around us.\nThere's the world, the trees, the forests, the people,\nhistory, animals, stars, yes.\nbut this we don't have access to, it's...\nto say we have access exclusively to words\nthe words that will make\nmediating between us and what we call the world\nand that's how we give it consistency, it's through this little a\nIt is placed in the lower right-hand corner of the master's discourse.\nand the other two discourses that will come to try to solve this problem of a\ni.e. to neutralize it or even naturalize it...\ni.e. make him native himself of the discourse\nthey will be treated differently by the hysterical and academic discourse\nAs we have already seen, this is the essence of the two previous seminars.\ndedicated to exploring this dynamic\nhere we have three discoursees that\nin some ways are variations of the master's discourse...\nObviously we're in the master's discourse.\nwhen operating in this ratio between S1 and S2\nbut we're also in the master's discourse, paradoxically,\nin the hysterical discourse or in the academic discourse , not in the same way but in the master's discourse\nWe're within our possibilities to solve this little \"a\".\nof the master's discourse, to settle it, to solve it\nMoving on to another discourse\nso here we have in these three discourses\nwhat Lacan calls the spherical mode\nthese are unequivocal discourses\nunequivocal means that in order for us to have a chance to understand ourselves we have to manage that.\nroughly speaking, the words\nmeans for each of us the same thing\nif we say \"wall\" we suppose we'll all \npicture the same thing\nwhereas if you go through the\nthe analyst's discourse that only arrives in the twentieth century\nwith Freud and Lacan who puts it in the form of a matheme\nthat reveals how it works\nin particular by this system of discourses\nthat stage for each of us issues of our own jouissance\nin the way that desire functions in the signifiers, nevertheless, Lacan says \"it is Freud through his exploration of the unconscious\nby the definitive formulas he found for the unconscious\nthrough his clinical work, which is the founder of the analyst's discourse\".\nthis analyst's discourse how is it different?\nthese three discourses are spherical, he's moebian?\nThat means for the other discourses\nAs we've seen, words always end.\nby referring to a referent, which is one thing...\nwe can't just stay in the words, however the work of analysis\nis precisely to reset this\nbeginning in such a way\nthat the cut actually took place\nthe cut is of course \nThe cut between words and things, since the\ncut between words and things\nit's only in the analytical discourse\nthat it is Moebian, (which means designed on the model of the M\u00f6bius strip)\nfor which you go from one side to the other without crossing any edges.\nso what are we talking about then? we're talking about \"les tours dits\" (the spoken tours).\nWhich is written with a T since it's the tour of the said, the passage from the saying to the said and from the said to the saying\nthis passage is what Lacan calls the double loop cut...\nbecause it is no longer possible to\nrefer to an imaginary consistent universe\nthat's why Lacan says that \"there's nothing else in the world that a small object \"a.\"\nbecause the point of the analysis is to bring the subject who said something\nto reconnect this said to his saying,\n that is to say, to get back..\na kind of reset of the\nsystem, as we would say today\nIn the ability to say; so the said takes origin on the saying\nfor there to have been a said it would have been necessary, in the past future, that there has been a saying\nso the passage from the saying to the said and from the said to the saying and thus the cut is operative.\nand that cut, of course.\nit's nothing more than the subject itself.\nthe cut itself is the subject\nit's very surprising not to find that...\nin the comments on \"l'\u00e9tourdit\"\nbut at the same time is it so amazing\nthan that? since what we're talking about here is getting to say\nis that the analyst discourse is nothing more than the social bond\nproduced by the analytical cure\nWhich will have been carried to its logical conclusion. At that moment there are no more illusions to be made\ni.e. we are really cut off the world\nThat's true castration. That's where also that true psychoanalysis takes its dimension\nStrictly speaking, poetically\ni.e. the passage from the signifier to the meaning\nand back to the signifier, so we\ngo from said to saying and from saying to said...\nand we accept that, in doing so there's a rebalancing\nwhich is done in such a way that the\nsubject may give birth at that time\nOf a new master signifier who can't\nthus join the ancient knowledge\nit's another way, it's...\nsomething else that's going on and what\nanalytical discourse is a whole\nother \"stuff\" than the other three\nobviously in these comments on \"l'\u00e9tourdit\", it is never mentioned.\nlet's just say that what is forgotten\nnowadays\nin the comments on \"l '\u00e9tourdit\"  is simply the topology.\nThe passage to the structure, the strict\nhomology between structure and topology\nit's a question of discourse , and first of topology, so of places\nsince I remind you that the\nlanguage has two main functions\nfirst of representation: therefore the one that works in all three discourses\nsecond of place, and only the\nanalytical discourse helps to clarify\nHow the other three discourses work. And the minimum we have to do\nas we talk about the analysis\ntherefore of the analyst's discourse since\nthe analyst operates only from the discourse that conditions it\notherwise It's not analysis, it's psychology.\nhence of the academic discourse\nwhich is the more antagonist to the analytical discourse\nso if we go back to the analytical discourse\nwhat we learn from \"l'\u00e9tourdit\"\nIt first concerns  the psychoanalysts\nIt's about psychoanalysts,( I was going to say the real ones)Those who put themselves at the service of the analytical discourse\nnot those who serve the academic discourse.\nsince this is the opposite of the analytical discourse...\nso the question to always ask ourselves is:\n\"in what discourse did my subject get caught? \u00bb\nfor in psychoanalysis\na priori the subject is spoken before being\nspeaking and so he's caught\nin a discourse, and  that's how he apprehends. Lacan gives an example\nno mean feat since he's going to talk about Ferdinand de Saussure...\nwhen he talks about the arbitrariness of the sign\nWhen he invents linguistics, it's a science, and science at first.\nis in the order of the hysterical discourse\nsince it's a challenge to the unconscious  knowledge of the master and a fall of knowledge\nwho will be carried by the truth of\nthe hysterical one.\nthe truth comes down to knowledge, it comes to pointing out the flaw of knowledge\nand a scientific possibility is about to arise. So F. de Saussure invents linguistics...\nwhich is a science and in doing so he is\nin the hysteric's discourse\nBut without knowing it, Lacan specifies it in \"radiophonie\", he's not an analyst\nwhich keeps him from being an idiot...\nby wanting to be a scoundrel, because\nthe scoundrel in the psychoanalytical approach\nis the one who doesn't want to play the game of a discourse\nAnd to take over the jouissance of others\ndiscourse without playing the discourse game\nbut F. de Saussure is not a\nanalyst, nor is he a scoundrel.\nand so he won't go dumb because what happens to scoundrels is that they get stupid...\nLike Miller, for example. Here we have F. de Saussure.\nsomeone who's in the hysterical discourse\n and who, by uttering the words \"arbitrary sign\"...\nFalls without knowing it, in the master's discourse...\nhe doesn't know about the fall, but as we can't connect the signifier with the signified...\nshowing a discrepancy between the two, that there is no way to correlate\nto bridge that gap\ndoesn't mean it is arbitrary\nthat's where saying \"arbitrary\"\nhe goes back to the master's discourse\nSo that's an analytical approach.\nso the approach that allows \"l'\u00e9tourdit\" is to come back\nOn the foundations of psychoanalysis, very simply, an approach to discourse\nsince psychoanalysis is\na discourse and as a discourse\nit's a discourse clinic.\nwhich takes into account the\nspecificity of each of the discourses\nOf the three discourses and the analytical discourse which is no better than any other discourse...\ncontrary to what one might think following this introduction\nbut that's what makes it possible to pinpoint very precisely\nabout what is happening with the other discourses and the way they work\nand it makes it possible to understand today when you're in the academic discourse\nwe're in a corrupt master's discourse as Lacan says\nAnd when we're into the hysterical discourse, we're in the possibility of science\nso when, for example, someone like Macron says: \n\"there is no scientific consensus.\"\nIt's a contradiction in adjecto. Scientific consensus doesn't mean anything\nThere is never scientific consensus\nsince science is born of dissensus\nthere has to be dissensus for there to be science.\nsince the scientific truth that will appear at a moment is a fall of already established knowledge\nso there will never be scientific consensus\nso it's all ideological smoke and how could you not see it?\nprecisely if we are in this analytical perspective\nopened by Lacan and deployed in \"l'\u00e9tourdit\"\nAnd to comment \"l'\u00e9tourdit\" without mentioning the Discourses, topology,\nThe specificity of the analyst's discourse\nwhich is a Moebian discourse\nCompared to other discourses that are spherical and unambiguous\nWhile Moebian discourse is multi-vocal, in the passage from saying to said and from said to saying\nIt's the poetry of analytical discourse, but  not a hollow poetry.\nis the very poetry of being, since we\nare caught up in this discourse\nand it allows us to assume the castration\nthe assumption of castration\nthat's still the goal of psychoanalysis, but...\nwe know that psychoanalysis proposes at the end of the cure\nalways the rock of castration. There are few who pass the rock of castration\nsince there is little approach of the kind that distinguishes\nespecially in \"l'\u00e9tourdit\" where it's strictly about that.\nthe relation of the discourses, topology, and structure\nand the difference between\ndiscourses that are spherical and therefore closed\nand the discourses that allow the real cut called the double loop cut,\nthe Moebian Cut which only takes place from the emergence of the analytical discourse\nand especially for the analysand because he put his own skin in the story.\nbecause otherwise it's impossible to understand\nHe may be smart, Badiou, and I...\nwould say Cassin even more\nin that little book we read, but they\ncan't do it because they're not in analytical discourse...\nthey're in an academic discourse\nAnd when you're in the academic discourse\nyou're at the antagonism of analytical discourse...\nthen there's another approach that has interested us lately\nit's the Mandeville approach.\nBernard de Mandeville whom Lacan talks about in \"l'\u00e9thique\"\nwhich gave  ideas to some people\nnotably this philosopher who is\ninteresting to read, Dany Robert Dufour, who exhumed some Mandeville's texts including an absolutely wonderful text\nabout hypochondria and hysteria, dialogues...\nimagine dating back to 1700, it's exceptional, absolutely great.\nAnd Mandeville's thesis on the political dimension of\nwhat's going on there it's very applicable today.\nexcept we would not use the same words anymore, and so for Mandeville.\nthe tripartition that we find in psychoanalysis with Lacan\nin the embedded language structure that\nare: neurosis psychosis and perversion\nWell, at Mandeville's, there's gonna be a trilogy, too, but...\nit's not exactly the same since it takes a moral stance\nand an imagination based on fables:\nthe fable of the bees\nbecause Mandeville is the English translator of La fontaine.\nSo he wrote this as a fable and developed this thesis which cost him dearly...\nsince he's been disgraced as \"Man Devil,\"\ni.e. the devil man\nfor showing that the vices\nhad made the fortune of public goods\nand therefore the way he\nexplains this political functioning\nis that the bulk of the masses, the neurotics...\nto put it that way\nthose are the ones that are caught in the ego\nlacan shows that the self is a\nsymptom, that's the first symptom.\nAnd the ego doesn't want to hear about\nthe gap between the neurotic's self-image\nand what he's really doing\nso there's a discrepancy there that makes him manipulable, especially the obsessive one.\nbecause he's a man of many words, and you can just pay him with words;\nWith the social networks he's still paying himself with more words, so they he think he is virtuous.\nAnd imagining himself virtuous, he's going to lecture everyone\nHe preaches to others and then he gets himself\nsatisfied with this kind of blockage\nneurotic balancing act that's going to make\nthat he has a rewarding self-image...\nso it's self-defined\nwith two other populations\nThat neurotic who's the bulk of the\ntroop and which precisely allows all political manipulation\nwith what Mandeville calls the villains.\n\" villains\" obviously has a very strong moral connotation\nas likely to commit crimes etc.\nbut if you have to take them on a level that's not moral...\nthat is just ethical, since basically Lacan's work\nwas to transform the\nthree embedded language structures\nyou can't help but belong to one of these three structures...\nWe can go around in circles\nin any way that's impossible.\nNot to belong to one of these three...\nstructures neurosis psychosis perversion\nSo the villains, well, you could say...\nif we take them out of the moral dimension zone\nThat is to say, the mores of the XVIII century, but today there are also mores\nThat's the base of morality\nThese are the subjects who cannot register\nin a discourse, but as Lacan says...\nwhat characterizes the psychotic is they're missing a signifier.\nThe psychotic  can't get to know\nbecause he lacks a signifier\n\"the father's name\" precisely and therefore\n he can't get into a discourse.\nmost of them are adapted to the society\nand some, effectively, become serial killers who are capable of the worst scoundrels,\nthese can't fit into a discourse\nand then there are those who could fit in\na discourse because it's not a structural impossibility\nBut who don't want to join\nthey want to try to steal the\nenjoyment without playing the game\nWhose jouissance is ordered from an\ndiscourse, these are the perverts.\nobviously it is those who are holding, like\nVoltaire said:\n\"the little number who holds and makes the big number act\", who's manipulating all of this,\nso we're pretty close to conspiracy\nand all the fashionable ideas\nnow you can say as soon as\nyou don't agree\nwith the bullshit of the dominant discourse, you are suspected\nOf conspiracy, of plotting,\nSo, yes, there's a conspiracy, but as in\nkafka: a plot without conspirators\nbecause the conspirators\nthemselves don't know that they're already being manipulated by the signifier\nas a friend once said: I'll stop scheming\nWhen you stop plotting behind my back...\nThere's no conspiracy, but there's still a conspiracy that is a unconscious conspiracy\nthat is to say that they themselves are the play of the signifier...\nSince the signifier orders what happens and\npsychoanalysis is what makes it possible\njust to reconcile oneself with the alienation\nwhich is produced by the signifier\nto allow the possibility of an emerging subject\nAs seen in the form of a Mobian cut\nso the subject in psychoanalysis has absolutely nothing to do with subjectivity\nand subjectivity\nwhich is precisely what happens in the other three discourses\nstill, we can't say it has nothing to do\nsubjectivity carries the potential of\nsubject but the subject is the cut\nWhich has been realized from that potential and the subject is something that is real.\nprecisely because he can only be accessed through the symbolic\nbut he's no longer the symbolic\nhe is something that is always represented by a signifier for another signifier that does not represent him\nso it can't be directly perceptible, discernible\nAs soon as we talk about the subject we appeal to a signifier.\nto represent him. This is precisely what characterizes the psychoanalytic approach...\nin regard to other approaches including the philosophical approach\nand then the psychologizing or pseudo-psychoanalytical approach\nwhich is not the analytical approach because psychoanalysis\nis not to help people, as Lacan says...\nyou're gonna have a line out in front your practice. Psychoanalysis isn't like that.\nit is to allow the subject to conquer autonomy in the original sense of the word\nits own law, the law of the signifier, we've seen it,\nAnd to lead himself to his word since there is no other way out for the speaking being that we are\nthan to go to our own word...\nso what we actually find in Badiou, in Zizek\nBut also in many philosophers or\nof pseudo psychoanalysts\nbecause they are very nice, the school of Zizek in lubjana, the Slovenians\nexcept that they are not clinicians and therefore\nthey refer tall the time to ontology, but we've seen that ontology\nLacan writes it with an h (Hontology) because it is a shame to confuse the signifier and the sign.\nthis is not understood if you haven't been yourself on the couch\nor if we didn't go all the way.\nof the analytical cure, to its logical conclusion\nTo understand that it's the little a who is a semblance of ontology\npretending to \"be\" this little a, but it's\na letter pretending to \"be\".\nthere's no access to ontology. As soon as we ontologize, we're out of castration.\nwe get out of the fact that we're always caught\nin a discourse represented by a signifier for another signifier who doesn't represent us\nand we're swinging between said and saying  between enunciated and enunciation\nthat's what we're learning in the analytical discourse\nIndeed there's no room for ontology; that's why Lacan\ncalls it a \"honte au logis\" (shame at home),  shame not to dye of shame\nbecause to get out of this shame\nyou should be ashamed of yourself.\nto boast a representation of the world\na weltanschauung where precisely this is the order of the master's discourse\nIt's a substitute for a world view, but for a psychoanalyst there is no more.\nthere fore it is a \"saint\" position, not to be understood in the moral sense.\nBut in the sense of Mencius or Baltasar...\nGracian that is to say to un-charity\nit's exactly how Lacan treats \"ontology\"\nthat Badiou and the other philosophers would want\nthat is to say a not-being so it's a\ndiscourse of the master/being\nThis being here is just a semblance\n since what we have access\nIt's exclusively a letter, a\nletter that works with other math\nin a discourse, since we are a product of the discourse\nThere is no reality that is not discourse-generated\nso just appearing to be so is both what is not, what appears to be...\nit shields both senses of the\nterm\n\"pare\" as fend off a blow,  the blow of being\nAnd \"pare\" in the sense of embellishing, it is appearance but there's no being.\nBeing is what is given by its absence.\nwhich is not to say that there is no being\nit means that as a subject we don't have access to it.\nsince what characterizes us as\n subject is this punch between\nThe barred subject and  object a (the\nlogic of fantasy)\nwe only have access to our fantasy through whose tropism we see the world...\nor we represent it (weltanschauung)\nbut the minimum for a psychoanalyst is\nto know that and therefore not only to know that\nbut to take this into account in what he says or what he does.\nIf, for example, Jacques Alain Miller, who is pretending to be a psychoanalyst\nRealized what he's saying, he'd stop\nto bring the psychoanalytic institution\non the spans of gender theory\nwhich is nothing but an emanation\nof the capitalist discourse which is the more decadent  and delirious form of the master's discourse\nit's the master's discourse.\nthat goes through the academic discourse\nand that becomes a justification for a \"self\"\ni.e. a subject that is not more subject but is imagined\nwhich would give him the opportunity to\nuse signifiers to do whatever he wants with them.\nso it's absurd, you can see that it has nothing to do with \"l'\u00e9tourdit\"\none of the major Lacanian text by whom precisely\nwe can talk about what there is to be said as a psychoanalyst\non what's going on with this kind of fantasy about a virus\nwhich is absolutely mind-blowing if you think about it, the way the society operates\nand then those who hold it\nthose who are in the place of the rulers, it's  something kind of massive\nVery very curious to study: the behaviors and the gap that there is\nbetween what's known and what is represented, and the way some objects are fetishized.\nis absolutely mind-blowing.\nI'm talking about the mask, of course, but not only\nthe threat of lock-down, the so-called\nsocial distance, people who make little crosses\nor little squares outside their store\nand ask you to wait an hour before entering the shop\nall of this is absolutely delirious, but we still notice that this world has strictly no sense\nbecause it is penetrated by the real and makes a delirious interpretation of it\nmassively delirious\nwe can now talk about something a little bit more technical\nbecause all comments that are made on\n\"l'\u00e9tourdit\" do not mention anything about topology\nfrom the point of view of the structure, i.e. of the discourse\nIt also does not address the topology...\nin the form of its geometric representations\nand in particular the crosscap\nsince the crosscap is the only figure a priori\nwhich allows us to conceive how\nthe three discourses that are spherical\ncan be related to analytical discourse\nIt's not just that analytical discourse is\ndifferent from the other three\nit's also about being able to move from one discourse to another\nthe passage of a discourse to another and the crosscap is that figure there\nthat's the rimbaldien\"new love\", Rimbaud' conception of love\nwhich means we go to the dead end of a discourse and then we flip over, so it's a quarter turn\nfor each of the mathem of the discourse and then we go on to a new discourse.\nand this is actually the\" new\nlove\". That's how analytical discourse\nwhich is the discourse of love, the discourse of transference actually,\nis what allows the absolute counterpoint\nof everything that's going on right now\nbecause what you're going through right now\nit's the very negation of love.\nalready rhetorically induced by the capitalistic discourse as we know\nWith that you lose all the things of love and\nindeed the \"new love\"\ni.e.transference love which is true love as Freud says.\nthat love can be found again through analytical discourse...\nwhich is the counterpoint, we see it in \"l\u2019\u00e9thique\"...\nAs it is today in this fashion for corona by promoters of all kinds\nall sorts of promoters of what they call the \"pandemic\".\nWhich is absolutely not a pandemic , at the\nlimits an epidemic or endemic\nendemic but not a pandemic.\nit's not for everyone.\nand the commandment that is induced by the generated behaviors\nby the establishment of governments is: \n\"Beware of your neighbor more than yourself\"\nbut psychoanalysis is precisely the word of ethics which can be found  both in Freud\nthat stops on it because Freud knows what he's talking about\nso who stops at the command\n\"loves\" and who\nrealizes the shock that this means to him\nAnd Lacan will analyze this and says that Freud is right to stop on this, but it's actually\nit's really the ultimate horizon of ethics, not just psychoanalysis...\nIt's all about \" love thy neighbor as thyself\"\nwe're at the very opposite of this actual distrust or mistrust of the other  considered as pestiferous\nand which will lead to an explosion of all kinds of pathologies...\nTherefore psychoanalysis  even though completely innovative\nbecause it brings this analytical discourse to the 20th century with Freud...\nit can actually be connected anyway.\nto this subversive aspect,at its last degree, \nof the Christic appearance\ni.e. at the beginning of Christianity the possibility offered of this love\nor the relationship between Judeo and\nChristianity is the relationship\nBetween the symbolic and the real. What makes Christianity as such\nis the fulfillment to the end of\nJewish law\ni.e. by integrating the Christ body\nitself which is beyond the law...\nto the hold of the symbolic on the law\nas we saw, it's the object a.\nThe reintroduction of the object \"a\" under\nthe form of the resurrected Christ\nAnd it was brought by Freud himself, not Lacan the Freud reader\nby Freud himself in \"civilization and its discontent.\" he brings this and Lacan is very surprised\nand it deploys that possibility\nso everything today, everything that concerns\nthe father's defiance, the struggle\nagainst patriarchy etc.\nis  absolutely the most anti-psychoanalysis\nSince it's this empty place of the father, this\nunoccupied place which is the same as in democracies\nthe empty place of democracy that allows the system to work\nso Lacan's counterbalance is going to make a play on words with \"noms du p\u00e8re\" (father's names)and \"non dupes errent\" (the non dupe wanders)\nAnd allows precisely for the subject to\ndifferentiate from the real father\nof the symbolic father and the father\nimaginary.\n\"l'\u00e9tourdit\" is the passage from modal to nodal.\nthe modalities are the modalities of the impossible\nthe impossible that strikes every discourse\nthen differentiates the impossible that's on the top bar.\nthe impossibility of governing, educating and so on.\nWith the impotence that doesn't allow the\nreturn since they are open circuits\nthe return from the lower right place to the lower left place\nand impossibles have different names\nfor the master's discourse\nthe impossible is incompleteness.\nit's easy to see why, since it's\nnot complete since there is the \"a\"falling .\nto represent as being ( i.e. an imaginary consistency of a universe)\nFor the academic, it's the undeniable.\nsince the academic is in the concealment of the master signifier\nSo all these logical demonstrations\nare going to be wobbly, there's something that's going to hold up\nsince  the Master signifier is hidden\nand so as a S2.\nh e occupies this place to be the agent to address the astute, the little a\n\"the pedant au pd (gay)\" as Lacan says\nin a \"l'\u00e9tourdit\"; no one talks about that either, right?\nthere's something untraceable. For the hysterical it's the inconsistency\nand for  the analyst the impossible is called the undecidable...\nOne can never decide since an interpretation is like an oracle\nit only proves to be true by\nresults it gets, but in the meantime\nit allows the passage of the oscillation\nfrom said to saying and from saying to said\nso it reposition the subject and \nmoves him such a way that he assumes that position...\nto be signified by a signifier\ntherefore by the word and therefore not to decide\nit's undecidable\ncompared to earlier we can say that now you're staying in the sense\nAnd you don't fall into a meaning\nwhen you're in a meaning (this means that)\nWell, it's decided, whereas in the analysis it's not, since you're still\non sets of signifiers and\nso you stay on the level of signifier.\nAnd you don't fall into the signified so into the meaning\nit's the oracle of Delphi...\nthat's how the possibility of boundaries was born...\nWith the oracle of Delphi where the words were unintelligible...\nand so each one would hear them at the mesure of his possibilities\nand depending on the ability of his interpretation\nhis destiny was taking this or that direction\nand that's how Oedipus responds to the oracle...\nfound himself performing the\nfate that from this myth allowed Freud\nto found psychoanalysis.\nthe hardest thing is to say anything.\nthat's why it's the game of free association.\nThen the analyst realizes\nThat he can't, he's governed...\nby the chain of signifiers that take\n him to say this or that\nit's about blowing up the link of\nthe chain of signifiers to allow\na change in the subject's position\nthe Master signifier is cut off from knowledge. (S1 is cut off from S2)\nand that's only in the analyst discourse\nyou read it from the bottom left: knowledge S2 is assumed\nIt's supposed, so under the bar, repressed, the analysand suppose it to the analyst\nbut the analyst also supposes it to the analysand, since for him, it's the analysand who knows\nbut he doesn't know that he knows\nso he's going to play over his object a\nHe puts his body in it and then this\ncrossing from a to S barred\ntherefore, the impossibility to analyse, of course, by the game the analyst plays...\nwith the analysand, (a kind of \"two players delirium\" one can say)\nbut unconscious delirium, and with some control\non the games of the unconscious at the \nlinguistics level that will allow the divided subject\nand thus, to the analysand to bring about\na new signifier, the signifier 1\nBut who's dumb, (an interpretation is as silly as an oracle).\nit's not something smart.\nIt's silly because it's not related to knowledge, and the impotence of the S1 to return to the S2\nthat's what makes it the\nsignifier 1, a signifier without signified\nit's a signifier that can only be defined by being different\nfrom the other signifiers, that's why its dumb.\nand that's how you can tell that\nparadoxically psychoanalysis is a praise of stupidity...\nas long as you accept the foolishness\nyou have to be very smart to accept stupidity.\nI expect nothing from the positions I take\nif not to express them, to manage them, to\nsay them in the most consistent manner\nto serve (as i see it) the analyst's discourse\nso it's a position effectively\nWhere the false distance disappears yes, there are issues at stake.\nmassive stakes and it is a question to say something about the analytical position\nin relation to these issues and actually it can't be\nIn the sense of the dominant discourse\nWho is the capitalist discourse\nIt's impossible we can't go into the meaning of all these pseudo reasons\nto say that every discourse is a reason\nso we can't be in those pseudo-reasons\nIt's about bringing out something\nnot of a knowledge, but knowledge about the truth.\nthe truth which can only be\nhalf-said but implying a saying\nso that's when Raoult speaks there's a\nsaying and a said, he says something from his experience\nand he's wearing his saying. It hasn't\nthe same value when a moron\nof pseudo-philosopher like Enthoven talks or some dummy reporter\nas I don't remember his name,\nCohen or Finkielkraut, talks.\nit doesn't have the same value, from saying to said and from said to saying, it doesn't have the same value.\nthere's not the same ethical contract because every discourse is an ethic\nRaoult has a contract with a sick person, he's sticking to something\nthere's a connection between his saying and his said\nIn the others it's just said, there's no saying, \nThey're talking, they don't know anything about it.\nthey don't even know they're caught in a discourse, so it's worthless.\nthey're in an academic discourse\nAcademic discourse is still an opportunistic discourse since it is bringing knowledge to the Master...\nand then, if possible, take over as a master of knowledge...\nI think the dumbest one is a dude.\nWho's called Laurent Alexandre, the\nfounder of Doctissimo who is really\na complete moron who thinks he's a\ngenius who can rule over the intelligence of others\nSo obviously they're waiting for it to pass.\nthey benefit from the situation, they are\nprecisely on the pervert side\nThat is to say, the pervert, I remind you, is not what we usually think.\nthe pervert is the position of a masochist who ignores himself as a masochist\nmore often than not\nthat is, who imagine that he knows\nwhat makes the Other enjoy (with a capital O)\nso he puts himself in the position of knowing what makes the Other enjoy\nin fact, It's a way of governing. How are they governing right now?\nIt's not hard to guess. They have polls made, you can the polls to say what you want.\nso, they still need that the majority of those who elect them\nmust think that the government is doing something\nbecause they can't just sit back and do nothing\nWell, yes, but they must not show it in any case, and so they think to themselves\nlet's see if people imagine that the mask will protect them\nso, we may have scientific studies that demonstrate that it's totally unnecessary\nfor all lung infections including corona virus\nIt's a proven fact, we've been knowing it for ten years, but they're going to find out that\nthere's a sufficient percentage of people who would be reassured by wearing the mask\nso they decide that the mask will be mandatory regardless of the consequences\nas long as it is reassuring a majority\nThat's a perversion!\nThat's true populism, populism is nothing else but that\nto imagine what will make the people enjoy\nso we're going to take action based on popularity ratings, polls etc.\nand we very know that the way they are phrased makes them say anything\nWe're going to instil some language elements from there\nthat's what it's called, and then it's done.\nSo we end up with a pair of underpants on our heads imagining we are protecting ourselves against the corona virus.\nwhich is totally untrue, but this will reassure\napparently over 60% of the population\nand so, it's a decision that's going to be made\nand that's 60% is obviously the\nthe big neurotics, that is to say, the ones\nWho have a high opinion of themselves, who imagine themselves virtuous people\nthey've never explored their dark side of the force\nas it says in a well-known saga  and so they imagine they're good.\nand there's nothing worse than the ones that\nimagine themselves to be good\nbecause they don't want to know anything about it, and...\nso, they're going to moralize the others\nThey want to prohibit them from jogging\nthey'll opt for lock down; they'll clap their masters on the balcony at night\nSo, you need this possibility of an analytical approach\nand to bring psychoanalysis to the political dimension\nwhich is its original dimension since the police is the city\nthe city is language and language is what is opposed to nature.\njust to deploy, as a conclusion, I would like to say for today:\nlogos is what is opposed to nature, the difference between the speaking being we are with all the other species\nis that we're not directly\nreferent of an environment,\nwe are not directly correlated to it. All animals are part of environments\nfor there to be mosquitoes there has to be water and certain types of plants...\nfor a cougar, it must live under some conditions and not under others\na crocodile also, cows, goat...\nwhatever you want needs environment\nWho possesses the truth of his being here; for the human being\nfor the speaking being there's no environment,\nMen can live anywhere because their environment is language itself.\ni.e. they are caught as a subject, they belong a priori to a discourse\nthey don't know it, but they are part of a discourse\nso their ecosystem depends on their discourse\nthat's why psychoanalysis is a discourse and a discourse clinic\nso it's a critical approach to discourse. Let's not forget that desire\nWhich is the analytical basis for\nexcellence since it is indestructible\nThat's how Freud ended his traumdeutung...\ndesire is indestructible\nthe desire itself is actually what makes law to the subject\nWe are subjects of desire, subject to\ndesires, and language is the law of desire.\nso it's the laws of language\nthat over determine us, which means it's a determination\nthat comes on top of all the other determinations\nDeterminations can have\nnatural physics laws\nWe are subject to gravity and\nmany other natural laws\nbut the laws of language take over his, that's what Freud discovers with his \"enwurf\".\nwe are primarily determined by the laws\nand so, it's through language and by the discourse that we can\nreseed the possibilities of the subject that we are\n"]]
